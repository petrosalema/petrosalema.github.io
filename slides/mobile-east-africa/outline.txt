a swahili proverb: bend the fish whilte it is still wet

parents get this. mature things are harder to change

fishmonger see it in kids and fish -- I see in this the basis upon which
technology adoption succeeds

#www
consider the web: a good illustration for us because we know it to still be
massively potential but established

why is it that these companies--the most successful web companies--represent
only 2 business models: ecommerce and social networks?

#logos
these companies you see on the screen are companies that don't sell software!
the web gave us huge software companies that don't sell software

#bill gates
this is remarkable considering that at the time of the web's birth bill gates
bacame the richest man in the world through building a company around the
business model of selling software 

and business patterns don't change unless they have to, so you can bet that there
were plenty of early web companies tried thought to move desktop applications
onto the web and charge money from it. We this doesn't work. Why?

Well, you can't bend the fish once dried.
Bend the fish while it is still fresh.

#
"Free and open" became the accepted and expected.

#tweet about paywall

The internet matured in a way that people came to expect that products and
services served from the web will be free. There were many reasons for this, but
this was the accepted user behaviour.

payed subscrptions, paywalls, and freemium are attempts to bend an already dried
fish. I'm not saying you won't get rich by charging for your software on the
web, I'm just Google rich--not on the web.


#
What is important to understand is that, in this analogy, the fish is not web
technology itself, the fish is user expectations--the norms of user behaviour.
Societal expectations of how things should work.

And the most successful companies are those that didn't break that behaviour but
accomodated it and exploited it.

The reigning business model is essentially to earn commission on selling physical
goods, or selling your attention.

Marketplaces and advertising companies that serve your taste and attention
soficiticated software offered for free.

Until today, there are many here who have never paid for software on the web.

Why most of us here do not pay for most of the very sofisticated expensive
software that we use day in and day out.

Web companies do not thrive by forcing change on social norms.
They succeeded by designing products and engineering systems that aligned with
them social paradigmn.

Disruptive technologies are by necessity not disruptive

And I think that this is what is so brilliantly evidenced by the mobile
revolution that has taken place in East Africa.

This is what makes it so noteworthy.

Make no mistake, what has happened, in Tanzania and Kenya, is permantent
disruption. And the quesion that we keeps asking is why did mobile banking and
digital currency take hold here an not elsewhere.

I want, today, to tell you about the phenomena of how East Africa came to the forefront of digital currency.
I want to tell you about how digital currency has become permantently disrupted .
I want to tell you of how a society went from cash society to a cash-less society--leapfrogging the west's plastic society
I want to tell you about how digital currency has become thoroughly embedded in
financial fabric of a society where day-long powercuts are still the norm.

And I hope you will gain insight into what is obvious but often overlooked about
disruptive technology. And I hope to draw lessons from this that will be of great benefit to you.

Permanent disruption is what has happend in EA

What you have today in Tanzania is a cashless society. What I don't mean is that
nobody uses cash, but any person in Tanzania can live his day and do financial
almost every needed fanancial interaction without using cash.

What is remarkable about what is going on is that
Not plastic but digital.

I have a sister who lives and works in Tanzania.
Petrina would go to work by taking what they call a Majadi (picture)
When she arrives at work she wouldn't pay in cash or credit card which requires
tones of infrastructure. She would simply ask for her drivers phone number
really quick and press a few buttons on her phone and pay for her cab ride.

No cash involved. No bank involved. 2 mobile phones, 2 telephones numbers.

Petrina would go for pizza for lunch and pay the tab for all her friends.
To do that should would ask the waiter for the local's mobile number and make a
mobile payment. No cash.

Back at the office, the friend won't pay her back in cash or deposit money to
her paypal or something. What they would do is pull up her contact details on
their phone and simply transfer money from their phone to hers. Debts resolved.

Petrina also pays her eletricity bill by sending money to the mobile number of
her utility provider. And ofcourse she pays for her internet and telephone the
same way.

Petrina's an architect so you think she got a wiz bang samsung galaxy 3
whatever.


example of the mkokoteni puller

Maize on the streets, bartering at the market.

That, my friends, is a cashless society.

And what is remarkable about this futuristic situation that so many east
Africans are living in is just how unremarkable it seems. How mundane disruption
feels.

Stats feature phones
Wakala

We feel about NFC that we need to do the spoke sign.

Bitcoin, silk road, pirates, hitmen, and drugs, mysterious tech wizary at a
mountain caled gok.
mpesa and you think of bills and lunch tabs.
That's hugely Significant to understand why digital currency had
worked so well.

The story of how Tanzania and Kenya found themselves at the for front of 
digitial currency begins with the story of MPESA


Mpesa began

transferable or storable electronic value


retail payments market, and is poised to equally profoundly transform the economics of financial service delivery in Tanzania.

Mpesa is a mobile service that
Mpesa did not start as a digital currency project



financial access points
Of the 55,851 outlets 81% of these are mobile money outlets

outlets = banks, pos, mobile money agents, atms, postal services

virtually all mombile money agents have another mobile money agent withing 250 meters from them.
that means you have thorough saturation

but only 25% have a bank in that distance.
This means that it is easier to deal with agents than banks
Why agents are just umbrellas

To get a feel of what it looks like to use your ohone like a bank acount let me
walk you though the user interface and instrastructe a little bit

lessons







When you say bitcoin we think silk road. When you say mpesa you think paying for
my lunch. That a huge difference in 







As I talk about the phenomena of mpesa, i want you to have that consideration in
your mind.








# Bend the fish while it is still wet

There is a Swahili proverb that says: "Samaki mkunje angali mbichi," which means
"bend a fish while it is still fresh." I imagine that anyone here who has maturing
children understands quite well what the sentiment behind that proverb means.
But I also see here a picture of how technologies and markets emerge.

You see, we all know that there are some things that are easier to change before
they have matured and are set in place. The fishermen of East Africa saw this
pattern in children, and fish. Well, technological systems show this behavior as
well.

Consider the web for a moment. I helps illustrate this because the web is still
massively potential, but at the same time it has been around long enough to have
established some rather well set norms.

# Amazon, eBay, Google, Facebook, Twitter

Why is it that the products that have excelled on the web essentially fall into
two categories: E-commerce, and Social networks? The most sucessful internet
companies have emerged as those that don't sell software as a consumer product.
What they sell instead are physical goods and services, or your attention. What
they well is not software but physical goods and attention.

Though the majority of their employees are producing software, software is not
their product. They are not so much software companies as they are
algorithmically enabled market places and algorithmically enabled advertising
companies.

The advent of the web put a moratorium the software as a product business model.
Even now, when we are in the age of the App Stores the open and free web
established the norm that software is free.

# Many desktop application

This is remarkable when you consider that at the advent of the web, it was the
selling software that turned a nerd into the richest man in the world. During
the desktop era none of those apps had any adveristments on them. So you
can bet that early web companies tried to follow the paid software model.

Getting people to pay for software never really worked that well though web. This is
because one aspect of the web that matured very early on was the paradigm that
the web was free and open. And so, if you were going to use the web to serve
software, you couldn't charge the consumer for it. Paywalls and freemium are
attempts to bend a fish that has already dried.

# The Attention Economy

So different software business model has emerged in the wake of the web:
Software like product tracking, spreadsheets, and word processing are offered
for free, and in return these companies either take commission on the goods you
buy it else sell your attention to the highest bidder. Being paid to recommend
or sell things to you.

# Disruptive technologies are by necessity very undisruptive

You disrupt the market, if you can, but not the user.

The parts of the system that can be changed are those that are still for what
ever reason still wet and underdeveloped.

It's important to undestant atht the proverbial fish in this illustration is not
the web technology itself--it is user behavior

If you want to bring about disruptive technology, you cannot disrupt an
established pattern of use. Disruptive technologies gain critical mass, and even
become civilizational technologies, not by disruptive social norm--at least--not
at first, but be enforcing and automating them.

Here is my point: disruptive technologies are in fact by necessity very
undisruptive.

# MPESA: permantent disruption looks like

I am using the web as a picture that I expect many of us here to be very
familiar with, but what has that got to do with rise of mobile banking in East
Africa.

◎- What does disruption look like (in numbers)

# Peope on phones in the underground

When disruption is true and permanent it will look remarkably unremarkable. We
don't even notice the fact that everyone in the metro is on their phones. We
didn't even invision this 10 years ago. Yet, now that it is hear we don't feel
like it's any big deal. We are only slowing coming to the realization of just
how much our interactions have changed.


It is suprising how unremarkable this tectonic change has been Imagine if you
could time-machine a guy from 1992. He's got reebocks high-tops on, listening to
2pac... on his walkman. And imagine you dropped him into Amsterdam today in the
metro. Imagine what he sees. He will see the people with headphone staring into
space. He get's that--they're listening to music. But then there will be this
strange thing that he will notice about all the people areound him--their all
hunched over this little devices. It would be so remarkable to this guys how
different social interactions are. But for us, we don't even notice this.



So I say that mobile money in EA is permanent disruption because for many of the
people who use it. It feels little different as to how you use telephones and
electricity. It's just a utility--litterally nothing to call home about. 

Now compare the notition of mpesa and how remarkable it is when you see this:
picture of a guy with google glasses on his face. And imagine today if you
walked into the ubahn and everyone had one of these on their faces.  You would
immediately notice.

You know that technology is permanent disruption when it feels so common place.

Augmented reality is not disruptive.


And make no mistake, what is happing in places like tanzania and kenya is
permanent disruption, and very deep intergration of sophisticaed technical
systems, in place where day-long power cuts are not a suprise.

You cannot disrupt a market by disrupting user behavior ingrained in societal
patterns. You disrupt a market by enabling user behavior.

SnapChat for example did not invent ephemeral messaging, questionable teenage
behavoir did that perhaps. SnapChat automated the processes of this behavoir, in
order to mediate the attention of its users. By the way who wants to bet that
SnapChat is the next advertising company?


Describe the rise:
if you go to tanzania today...


and yet it is hair bending a fresh fish

lack of stuff gave bent.


but there is more than opportunity in mature market.

how was this fish bent and why did I twirl here.



It tends to be that it is in those areas of the technological landscape
where for whatever reason a system is inefficient, broken, or complete that
the most disruptive changes to an system paradim can be accomplished.

It is on thise places where for whatever reason the proverbial fish is still wet,
whether from lack of resource, under development, immature markets, that
disruption can take place.

And that is what mobile banking has accomplished in east africa.

 ◎- Why then did this technology stick so hard in this region

    * The clue is in how unremarkable the technology is

	* Disruptive techology disruptes markets and industries but it does not
	  start by disrupting culture, it starts by augmenting (actually
	  reinforcing) sociaty form
	
	* Google doesn't work until we are condition to put stuff on WWW

	* WWW civilizational techology

 ◎- We should be suprised that it worked
    * Brief history of how Mpesa came to be

 ◎-  What are the implications for us as programmers and designers and product
 people?

Design features and products around things like:
Attention as ID
Privacy (facebook began with limiting network)
Trust (paypal)



"Technologies fail. That fact is depressingly normal."




` Suprising when it even works

It seems evident to me that as much as we consider the practice of designing and
building technology projects engineering, there is a good deal of mystery and
suprise when the final outcome actually works very sucessfully.

It is this that makes it worthwhile not only to discover about new technologies
that work, but also investigate the mechanisms behind their success.

We have BETAMAC, Diaspora, etc, etc. Of technically well built products that
didn't make it. Is is timing, pricing, or is it features, ...

In many ways, it may be easier to determine (through a product autopsy) why a
technology "failed" than it is to figure out why one is currently succeeding.

---

` What does permanent disruption look like?

Let me paint a picture for you with some numbers and then I'll put this in
anecdotal context.

What is truely remarkable about the emergence of mobile money in East Africa is
just how thoroughly unremarkable the technology appears on the ground.  Star
Trek outfit, through up their {Spok's race} salute before attempting an NFC.

So we ask: what does permanent disruption look like? It looks remarkably
unremarkable!

design is in the details
your product design is made out of hundreds of little details


banks killed the super agent





In this East African nation of 43 million people, almost anyone you meet has
used a phone to make a transaction. Over 90% of the population has a phone (up
from just 3% in 1999) and 96% of mobile phone users has used a handset to make
a mobile payment or for m-banking. Kenyans use their phones to pay electric
bills, taxi fares, get cash or even buy produce and other essentials in rural
markets.


Smartphones are also gaining ground in African markets though it might take a
bit longer, say, into 2014, before we see wholesale smartphone penetration
there. Overall, by the end of the year, 75-80% of the global handset market
should be dominated by smartphones.


Many of our big ideas about development rest on the assumption that the West
cracked the formula for economic progress sometime in the 19th century, and
what we need now is for the developing world to ‘catch up’. Even the language
we use encapsulates this idea, in the division between ‘developed’ and
‘developing’. 


The service was developed between Safaricom and Vodafone, and launched in 2007.
And it’s not just something used in cities or by big commercial interests. By
2010, over 50% of Kenya’s population had used it – this means rural villagers
haggling over produce, then using their Nokias to make the final deal. It means
Masai herdsmen bringing their phones to market along with their cattle, ready
to stock up on essentials to bring back to their homes.



Money is not paper, not plastic, but digital



In EA, banks and credit card companies simply do not have the hold on society as
they do here simply because so many people was excluded from their service

Other norms were in place, norms that digital money could help improve.
