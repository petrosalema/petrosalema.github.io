I believe that:

<strong>Vision is essential<b>:</b></strong>
The future you can imagine is the future you work towards<b>.</b> This is true
for your products and company, so always
<a href="/talks/dream-big-think-small">dream big, think small</a><b>.</b>

<strong>Beauty is fundamental</strong><b>:</b>
It is not functional if it does not delight and inspire<b>.</b> It is more than
having the unit test past and choosing a modern design aethetic

<strong>Code is strategic</strong><b>:</b>

Empathy is the great differentiator.
