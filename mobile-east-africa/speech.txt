# Bend the fish while it is still fresh

There is a Swahili proverb that says: "Samaki mkunje angali mbichi," which means
"bend a fish while it is still fresh."

Perhaps there are some here who have maturing children who understand quite well
the sentiment behind that proverb.

But today I want to borrow from this to picture how technology adoption succeeds.

You see, we all know that there are some things that are harder to change once they
have matured and are set in their way.

# The tendency of systems is to grow complex
# 0

There is a pattern in life that seems exaggerated in technical systems:
the tendency of systems is to grow, and as they scale in size they also scale in
complexity.

# 0 - 0

And the more complex a system is, the harder it is to change it. Drastic changes
to a system are more easily made when the wood is green--when components and
patterns are missing, or underdeveloped.

And the hardest form of complexity to manage is where constituent parts of a
system start depending on another components to work in a specific way.

Add a forth traffic light and you will cause accidents because the system is
expected to work in a specific way.

The fishermen of East Africa articulated this side affect of maturing in a
proverb. Once a fish has dried, you're just going to have to cook it as it is.

# www.

Consider the web for a moment. It helps illustrate this because we know that the
web is still massively potential, but it has also come far enough to see that it
to already set into some established norms.

# Amazon, eBay, Google, Facebook, Twitter

Why is it that these companies--the most successful companies to have emerged
from the web--fall into only 2 categories: they are either advertising companies
or marketplaces.

It is noteworthy that of the web's most successful sofware companies not one of
them actually sells software.

# Bill Gates

This is remarkable when you consider that at the advent of the web, it was
precisely the selling of software that turned a nerd into the richest man in the
world. During that time, you remember that, desktop applications never had any
advertisments on them. So you can bet that early web companies tried to follow
the paid software model.

# Free & open

The reason we don't pay for software on the web is not for their lack of trying.
This came about because one aspect of the web that matured very early on was the
paradigm that the web was free and open. And so, if you were going to use the
web to serve software, you couldn't charge the consumer for it. Paywalls and
subscription services, and freemium are attempts to bend a fish that has already
dried.

It's important to undestand that the proverbial fish in this illustration is not
the web technology itself--it is user expectations and society norms surrounding
the technology.

# Facebook notification

Rather than forcing changes to user behaviour and expectations, platforms that
gained traction were those that align themselves with user behaviour, and took
advantage of user norms.

What they did is rather than sell software they use software to either sell
physical goods, or use software to capture and sell your attention.

They are not so much software companies as they are algorithmically enabled
market places and algorithmically enabled advertising companies.

# Disrupting technology is by necessity very undisruptive

For a potentially revolutionary technology to gain broad adoption, it cannot do
that by disrupt the established fundamental pattern of use.

So I start with the web because this is a very familiar terrain for us.
And I wanted to demonstrate that the shift from software as a product to the
user as a product is fairly technonic, and it not come about by force new user
behaviours but by aligning with accepted patterns of user norms.

# Technologies are surfaced though interfaces and interfaces operate on the context of society

Technologies are of little consequence until they are surfaced through an
acceptable interface. And since consumer products operate in the context of the
society in which they're users live, a good virtual or physical interface must
be one that aligns with the accepted norms and practices of the users' societal
fabric.

And I think that this is what is so brilliantly evidenced by the mobile
revolution that has taken place in East Africa.

# m-pesa: what permanent disruption looks like

I want, today, to tell you about how East Africa found itself at the forefront
of digital currencies

I want to tell you of how a society went from a cash-based one to a cash-less
society, and in the process leap-frogging the West's plastic society

I want to consider how a digital currency becames so imbedded into the financial
fabric of a society where only 25% of the population had easy access to a bank,
and where day-long powercuts are still the norm.

# Petrina: cashless in east africa

What I don't mean is that nobody uses cash, but any person in Tanzania
can live his day and do financial almost every needed fanancial interaction
without using cash.

# majaji
# drinks
# debt resolution

# 70%? use mobile banking

# What is Mpesa?
# Fiat-backed transferable and storable electronic value
# phone binary tsh vs card $$ gold

The story of how Tanzania and Kenya found themselves at the for front of 
digitial currency begins with MPESA

What you have today in much of Kenya and Tanzania is a functioning cashless
society. Unlike the West, however, this cashless society is not facilitated by
credit cards but by a digital currency that is stored and transfered through mobile phones.

Mpesa a digital currency that is backed by the local currency. In the same way
that the dollar used to be backed by gold reserves during the gold-standard,
likewise mpesa is a shilling-backed transferable/storable eletronic value.

# Bitcoin

Mpesa is the most successful digital currency, but it is not the most famous one.
The most famous digital currency is Bitcoin.

Let me highlight some key differences between mpesa and bitcoin

# Pegged to local fiat vs free-floating
# Centralized/peer-to-peer vs decentralizd/peer-to-peer
# Known identity vs anonymous
# proprietry vs open source
# sms/ussd vs internet
# local vs global

There are many other differences but I highlight these because they are very
close to the user experience.

Aside from the fact that Mpesa has had incredible support from the governments
of Kenya and UK, and Safaricom and media, technically, I think that the most
important difference between is the fact that Mpesa is pegged to fiat on at 1:1 ratio.
And the fact that the money is not anonymous.

# ...
# free-floating
# ...
# anonymous

The fact that Bitcoin is free-floating and anonymous are some of its strength,
but when you consider it from a user interface perspective, these same strengths
are what make it hard to align with  accepted norms and expected patterns.

Those 2 characteristics are Bitcoins strength, but they are also Bitcoins user interface
problem, because they are so mis-aligned with how we deal with money.

# pirates, silk road, satoshi mount gocks == incompatible with "normal"

When I say bitcoin, those who've heard about it think of a silk road, drugs, a
pirates, hitmen, and mysterious guy called satoshi, and place called mount gocks

Weired stuff.

The highest level of user experience is the society, and socially bitcoin feel
incompatible with "normal".

# Bitcoin: Disruptive but in the wrong way

Bitcoin is distruptive, but in relation to mpesa it is also disptive in the wrong way.
It needs to be to be much more unremarkable.

# apple

mouse, click wheel, multitouch

# Mobile money disruption: nothing to call home about

So I say that mobile money in East Africa is permanent disruption because for
many of the people who use it. It feels little different as to how you use
telephones and electricity. It's just a utility--literally nothing to call home
about. 

Now compare the notition of mpesa and how remarkable it is when you see this:
picture of a guy with google glasses on his face. And imagine today if you
walked into the ubahn and everyone had one of these on their faces.  You would
immediately notice.

You know that technology is permanent disruption when it feels so common place.


# aligning technology to culture

Let me go a little into the architecture to show how it works so that we can see
how technology can be made to align with culture.

bank to super-agents

super-agent

mobile users depost and withdraw cash
mobile users transfer cash with each other or retail



















Augmented reality is not disruptive.




It tends to be that it is in those areas of the technological landscape
where for whatever reason a system is inefficient, broken, or complete that
the most disruptive changes to an system paradim can be accomplished.

It is on thise places where for whatever reason the proverbial fish is still wet,
whether from lack of resource, under development, immature markets, that
disruption can take place.

And that is what mobile banking has accomplished in east africa.


	* Google doesn't work until we are condition to put stuff on WWW


What are the implications for us as programmers and designers and product
 people?

Design features and products around things like:
Attention as ID
Privacy (facebook began with limiting network)
Trust (paypal)



"Technologies fail. That fact is depressingly normal."




` Suprising when it even works

It seems evident to me that as much as we consider the practice of designing and
building technology projects engineering, there is a good deal of mystery and
suprise when the final outcome actually works very sucessfully.

It is this that makes it worthwhile not only to discover about new technologies
that work, but also investigate the mechanisms behind their success.

We have BETAMAC, Diaspora, etc, etc. Of technically well built products that
didn't make it. Is is timing, pricing, or is it features, ...

In many ways, it may be easier to determine (through a product autopsy) why a
technology "failed" than it is to figure out why one is currently succeeding.

` What does permanent disruption look like?

Let me paint a picture for you with some numbers and then I'll put this in
anecdotal context.

What is truely remarkable about the emergence of mobile money in East Africa is
just how thoroughly unremarkable the technology appears on the ground.  Star
Trek outfit, through up their {Spok's race} salute before attempting an NFC.

So we ask: what does permanent disruption look like? It looks remarkably
unremarkable!

In this East African nation of 43 million people, almost anyone you meet has
used a phone to make a transaction. Over 90% of the population has a phone (up
from just 3% in 1999) and 96% of mobile phone users has used a handset to make
a mobile payment or for m-banking. Kenyans use their phones to pay electric
bills, taxi fares, get cash or even buy produce and other essentials in rural
markets.


Smartphones are also gaining ground in African markets though it might take a
bit longer, say, into 2014, before we see wholesale smartphone penetration
there. Overall, by the end of the year, 75-80% of the global handset market
should be dominated by smartphones.


Many of our big ideas about development rest on the assumption that the West
cracked the formula for economic progress sometime in the 19th century, and
what we need now is for the developing world to ‘catch up’. Even the language
we use encapsulates this idea, in the division between ‘developed’ and
‘developing’. 


The service was developed between Safaricom and Vodafone, and launched in 2007.
And it’s not just something used in cities or by big commercial interests. By
2010, over 50% of Kenya’s population had used it – this means rural villagers
haggling over produce, then using their Nokias to make the final deal. It means
Masai herdsmen bringing their phones to market along with their cattle, ready
to stock up on essentials to bring back to their homes.



Money is not paper, not plastic, but digital



In EA, banks and credit card companies simply do not have the hold on society as
they do here simply because so many people was excluded from their service

Other norms were in place, norms that digital money could help improve.

SnapChat for example did not invent ephemeral messaging, questionable teenage
behavoir did that perhaps. SnapChat automated the processes of this behavoir, in
order to mediate the attention of its users. By the way who wants to bet that
SnapChat is the next advertising company?



, it is nonetheless informative to note that cell phones have been
adopted more than five times as fast as fixed line telephone services, which took 100 years to reach 80
percent of country populations



iAlthough M‐PESA does not pay interest on deposits, and does not make loans, it can usefully be thought
of as a bank that provides transaction services and that has operated, until recently, in parallel with the
formal banking system.
Safaricom accepts deposits of cash from customers with a Safaricom cell phone SIM card and who have
registered as M‐PESA users.  Registration is simple, requiring an official form of identification (typically
the national ID card held by all Kenyans, or a passport) but no other validation documents that are
typically necessary when a bank account is opened.  Formally, in exchange for cash deposits, Safaricom
issues a commodity known as “e‐float,” measured in the same units as money, which is held in an
account under the user’s name.    This account is operated and managed by M‐PESA, and records the
quantity of e‐float owned by a customer at a given time.  There is no charge for depositing funds, but a
sliding tariff is levied on withdrawals (for example, the cost of withdrawing $100 is about $1).1
