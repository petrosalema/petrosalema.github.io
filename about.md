<h1>about<b>.</b></h1>

My name is Petro Salema<b>.</b><br/>
I am a <strong>React (Native)</strong> &amp; <strong>Angular</strong> expert who
helps companies get from <strong>vision</strong> to <strong>version
1.0</strong><b>.</b>

The companies I partner with are all working to make a difference---using,
software and design to bring the promises of tomorrow into the possibilities of
today<b>.</b>

&bull;

I believe that:

<strong>Vision is essential<b>:</b></strong>
The future you can imagine is the future you work towards<b>.</b> This is true
for your products and company, so always
<a href="/talks/dream-big-think-small">dream big, think small</a><b>.</b>

<strong>Beauty is fundamental</strong><b>:</b>
It is not functional if it does not delight and inspire<b>.</b> It is more than
having the unit test past and choosing a modern design aethetic

<strong>Code is strategic</strong><b>:</b>

Empathy is the great differentiator.
