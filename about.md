<h1>about<b>.</b></h1>

My name is Petro Salema<b>.</b><br/>

I am a <strong>React (Native)</strong> &amp; <strong>Angular</strong> expert who
helps companies get from <strong>vision</strong> to <strong>version
1.0</strong><b>.</b>

The teams I work with are vested in making a difference&mdash;using software and
design and product-thinking to bring the promises of tomorrow to the
possibilities of today<b>.</b>

What I bring to the team is expertise in mobile and web app development with
JavasScript, user-centric design, and strategic positioning.
    
Successful apps are not built on the drive to recreate what is popular, but on a
cultivated conviction about what differenciates you in the perspective of your
user.

Successs for me, therefore, goes far beyond getting the unit tests green.
It's about delivering delight to your users; it's about getting to the market
with a product that is worthy of your users' attention<b>.</b>

If you are a company with a vision to bring something impactful to market. I
would love to hear from you.

I believe that:

<strong>Vision is essential<b>:</b></strong>
The future you can imagine is the future you work towards<b>.</b> This is true
for your products and company, so always
<a href="/talks/dream-big-think-small">dream big, think small</a><b>.</b>

<strong>Beauty is fundamental</strong><b>:</b>
It is not functional if it does not delight and inspire<b>.</b> It is more than
having the unit test past and choosing a modern design aethetic

<strong>Code is strategic</strong><b>:</b>

Empathy is the great differentiator.
