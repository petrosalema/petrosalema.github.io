the epoch was in 1989
it was that year our on for years old wealth and Tanzania
was growing up in East Africa halfway around the world
a British physicist had an idea know some gonna change the world
it was the World Wide Web system
of document link with hypertext
accessible at will over the Internet
to a common user interface the brother up
genius disrupted revolutionary
like many things that were born from the internet
outcome a bit with a little bit unpredictable
but one thing is not questionable it was unquestionably
transformative and the context the thruster my discussion is gonna be on
this one question
this is how we're gonna leave this discussion what is it
about the World Wide Web that made it so transformative
what is it about the web that we know that gave its transformative power
now when did Tim berners-lee
invented the World Wide Web he introduced a couple of innovation
the Hypertech cap
Transfer Protocol Hypertext Markup Language
and the universal Resource Locator
all these were innovation that were brought with the web
but none of the in my opinion explain the
incredible phenomenon that the web became there is of course
innovation one that has become so common so used
we're so used to it that we can be looking at it we don't even see that
it's there
we don't see innovation that it is the browser
the common user interface for the Internet
do you know what the name of the very first
web browser was whether more they good
mosaic was a game-changer the fantastic piece of engineering was great user
interface
mark increases work with brilliant but the name on the very first web browser
get this the World Wide Web way DC
the World Wide Web was not an if the real system that guy came up with the
world wide web with an
Apple in with an ap with the front in a back-end
with an app to into interface with internet
and so Tim berners-lee in my understanding
he saw the Internet with massive potential information distribution
you and what he did working on a next computer if he took the concept
on the desktop motif the desktop interface
that with the birthright of the PC revolution
and he married with the connectivity to the Internet
he used this concept called hyperlink and I'm not sure where that came from a
science fiction book with a with a technical paper but this is what he did
and Internet had the browser on
he talk a technology a system that was invented
by the military the nerd that are but that time
way a system that was invented to keep the bombers flying
after a nuclear holocaust and we're all dead a filter system
and introduced the common user interface and he made a system
that went from a tool to a medium for the rest of us the world by web
this is how the internet kinda look like before the browser's
up this is nerd
this is Sheldon well not penny
way the tools for academics and engineers
the two for the military but it's not a medium
support for designers it's not a medium for journalists for doctors for business
people not immediately on
not until the user agent arrived at the browsers
and internet is not only
ubiquitous but it's usable
powerfully transforming it
Internet becomes usable everyday people
and I think it actually put a paradigm shifted
consider this the URL the universal Resource Locator
the this is the partnership that I think a
the brother brought we're not we're not talking about when files
on your local system we're talking about about
remote systems accessible to you so the internet
make the world your computer I think that the Transformers star on
HTML we're not talking about prepared very specific file format
we're talking about a general standard opened
extensible file format on I'll buy it was
originally designed to represent documents but we use are not make maps
and the browser
the masterpiece up
a concept the mood this from proprietary specific programs
way that work on proprietary specific file format
to open standard a general user interface
access biggest network that we have the Internet
and the w3c was born
with the World Wide Web and the BBC's mission if I understand it
is to basically disseminate these principles
open it in standard so that the web can be applied for more vigorous innovation
you and I think this is really transformative when I think that has
brought us to the place where we are
look at you where a bunch of nerds in a power talking about JavaScript how did
that happen
I believe the 1989 really was an apple
an hour in advance when you a pop
and I believe
that is just as much gonna lead to a user interface revolution at last
2014 this year has been predicted that this year
mobile internet use is gonna overtake internet using the desktop
this year right now put that in your release plans
put that in your road map it happening let me put this into context for you
alright computed it to be this way and
to work with the computer I would walk into wanted
then what happened is that would work up one and then what happened
their work with wanted now I carry my computer
way I heard they gonna wanna
where the thing gonna be fashion did you don't hear the rumor
that Apple was meeting with the FDA Food and Drug Administration
what sport injectable computers
where does that leave us
way whatever to a drop down menus our date pickers
them to jQuery was the web that we love where to go
when the screen disappears when we don't know which way the up and what we've
done
we don't know where the computer is we don't know what shape you're what shape
will take
what happens to the web way one way that I think I can approaches
it to consider the promises in the Pearl mobile
and how they relate to the web when we talk about the promise to the mobile
when this is Michael the thing that makes
the cell phone well mobile devices
so awesome is that it gives me completion computational power
with mobility that means I have computational power
when I'm at the restaurant computational power when I'm at beach computational
power them at the off with computational power
when I'm writing my want computational power when I'm supposed to be listening
to my
sister asked me to help her with a computer and
I'm be the on my phone
competition apart when filling out an airplane compassion up are everywhere if
another airplane hope it deliberately
nope a partial but I think
that's the power in the promise of mobile technology here's what I think
the problem in the perilous way Android
way is the really really fragment fragmented market when I was reading
that one the biggest problem have an Android is that some people are some
archaic prehistoric Britain Android and other people are on some bleeding and
shit
it's a really fragmented market well not consider that
and we're web crowd to this is really gonna heard
we've got silos again we've been sent back into the PC era
because we've got 100 over here we've got Windows
all the way here we the ISL s over here and they're not talking to each other
they're shooting pay toward each other and we're
we're like in the crossfire like ricochet will
and we've got silos for mobile app as well
well this is the peril it's very very
on the web all these tech titans to be working at a non-standard way and if the
departure would
market forces and this is a bad thing and here's how you gonna
I believe I can hit this point home imagine this
way imagine if you every time you want to use
Wikipedia you have to download it
and install it way what would happen to the Internet
if when you want to use Wikipedia you have to download and install it this is
what would happen
okay let's do it what version you gonna do
32-bit or 64-bit where you on a Windows or Mac personal
are you in the cold know you're going to you're free you
okay so you have installed you can use Wikipedia oh but WYD
to the word a hot pic did you get systems and secure
need to get the new version quick get online downloaded
your drivers were do you need an extra day alone to you your dependencies
worker
99 problems how do you do it with the web web platform is this mom
that we competed or Wikipedia dot com
but it turns out it doesn't matter awesome every time i visit Wikipedia
it's localized to my language it
rest of the block of it's the latest version
well I don't have to worry about hosting and I don't have to be wearing about
moving the fuck the wrong place I just remember URL
www World Wide Web Wikipedia
.org on that the web platform
the mobile arrow how things play on the mobile air when 99 problems
when a technical glitch in one way metres tall
Wikipedia when he got jelly bean a pic at
clinicians not work wait you're not on Android
you in a Mac Arthur using an iPhone when we're on a Windows Phone you got one of
those
well but your version is out-of-date we gonna do the updating again
your phone needs routing
don't support this out one other than knowing things that happen to me
you're crossing between the border love like rumania hungary and all the sudden
the App Store
won't let you download it because you're in the wrong country or something some
legal matters
way the payroll a mobile on
and that's why I think actually that the web has a lot to inform
the mobile revolution well I think we have a lot of thing
well I think the Cologne a lot from up
like I'm a told you
my passion and the team that I work with our mission
on to build a continental
we want to build content editor in a library
dole out of developers to build
digital native content authoring tools it's actually not a new idea
and Tim berners-lee
when he gave us the world by web he always had it in mind
actually he built a with a week editor in the very
very first browser he did not only have in mine
that the world wide web would be a place where you just harvest
and consume documents the World Wide Web
we have a brother that would allow you to produce the web
to grow the network way he had a vision blurry but where
way but to use jQuery parlance
way the promise other read write web way is long long deferred
overdue so we'll work it from the ground up we stop
and rethought way and we think
that that editing API is to be changed
you need to be made more friendly for developers
need to be more robust need to be in it work what much better
we have HTML which is a fantastic representational tool
but we have the dome which is a very very very problematic editing tool
been working really hard to try and bring system
library which allow people to basically the live the dream of the rebel web when
the rebel web have to be more than whatever the commands have provided at
the few
would likely work with at the commands or done any content at the bus stop on a
Wed
at the command you cannot and if you disagree just don't not
just pretend like I'm not thinking wrongful
at the command a float plane wreck 01
it basically the API that hi love
allows you to do basically the thing that you were able to do with the word
on the desktop
but it doesn't such a way that it is very very user unfriendly for example
you make everything ball to the classic problem unique
everything bold or you make a selection bolt
and you don't know which items were former to bolt
what we want to do with wanna build an API which allows much more low-level
actual
couple the other things you want to do is get rid of ranges a catastrophe of an
API
on I could talk to you more about that later
way but one thing we do believe
you I'm really passionate about little we think this is where the wind
in part can influence more about HTML
is a fantastic canvas representational
I believe HTML make a fantastic and the content creation
for for digital native authoring when mobile
on the only problem is way you're gonna have a lot of problems
when you gonna do that on your mobile home way and it goes beyond problem that
can be solved
responsive design in my opinion working on a tablet is great
way you can do all three will you on the train on the plane on a tablet you've
got to deal with that
my boss Clementi cod panicky
finicky it finicky sometimes touches really been a key
but you can't deal with it you can actually do proper editing
on a tablet when a mobile home
its really finicky and i actually thing
that we need to consider with a touch is necessary the interface for everything
that we need to do on them on a mobile device
with who specifically a mobile phone
we need to start thinking about what the transformation
but the web is bringing to how we do content creation
and basically what we even do with with computation so for example
it's no longer about new URL no longer but where
to resources located is about where you are located
and it's not about where you're located but by orientation
are you upside down are you lying down runo
de mi sono in which case maybe a user interface need to adapt or compensate
for the fact that when you touching it your fingers are wet
are you in bright daylight we already have the technology which brightens are
dim the screen is necessary
are you you know in a borrowing a lot place and therefore that
the out your settings need to be changed
so that you can interface but with the devices be there could be other concerns
that the web is bringing
you cannot be concerned with her two for the PC revolution this is what the
mobile
well the mobile revolution is going to bring us it's no longer
a file format all no longer about %uh PDF wedding along about our nation now
not about file format wat about your devices form factor
what are you holding your hand even holding anything in your hand
is it on your wrist your wrist down or is it up
you have to love them that the communique to the know how you handle
moving
the form factor not talking about just
TV screen tablet laptops computer screen
i'm talking about. when putting on my jacket
open my brother for the morning wearing my hat
wearing my email client you're making fun but
Google's building glass is there gonna be able to surf the web and
am I gonna be able to build editing experience when someone is sitting on
the on his bed late at night and he wants to write a little blog article
he doesn't apply his iPad got it has been added back
there and I would with with with glasses when we believe the interface with your
before we get to that
let me tell you why I actually have a problem
we doing with we getting on mobile devices
like phones so this is the classic with the classic set up we see
and for almost a year we're expecting that when we when we build a library
the problem that we're gonna try to be solving way doing with we getting in
something like this
but here's what shoes was really really problematic at Lisa
30 the screen is gonna be taken over with the soft keyboard way and because
the keywords are so finicky so hard to use
there's always going to be our completion by that picked up another
bill
little bit more space on top way well avert your eyes
missile your back and I don't know who
invent auto-completion but they have their mind in the gutter but in any case
they're working on technology to make that easier
so let your building with we get it or use it anytime controlled of course
and so where talking about what you see is what you get your
but that's all you can see you can hardly see any things like you're
looking for people eater edit on a mobile device
and its taking a sausage fingers going to win it sweaty its awful
oh yeah by the way when you gonna make a selection you've got this context menu
which was to be really helpful
at this point you just wanna smash your phone to give up are you seriously gonna
tell me someone is gonna write up
a report on it on his mobile phone we don't believe so
this is what happens but ugly I mean offense the guy who developed this
under think that's not this is not what our dream for we doing anything about
well-served Wed
what if we can have an implicit you I are you either did not clutter your
screen
what if we got a Wii real are you all right there so that what you actually
see
is more what you gonna get can we do that way
and what if we even got rid of the soft keyboard way
so that everything on the screen forget this other stuff I just that this image
of Jennifer get all this other stuff but the everything on there was just a texan
the images in the flowing content
as if you're reading at home what you see is what you get kinda added that how
can I do it
public do it but I have a keyboard Wed
you don't remember when we do use our phone and talking to them
do remember them look ahead it means to be the good old days
good do remember that good
it's the natural interface for the Fall right talk your phone
so what we thought is let's try it let's try to build an
editor using our new library codename howling mad
open secret to build an editor the didn't you
Pudge a mobile web the on touch
can we do it where foolhardy outdated
but you know you never know how far you can get and you never know the
the scope of the problem you never know the parameter the what you dealing with
%uh let's try simple
so we traded
goal that up
pray for me this is America who are you
going to a future command for you
go to the first header
skip the next word
again
select the next word
make a bold
make it ball
next paragraph
the next paragraph
delete the next image
select the next image
deleted
okie go to the first paragraph
select the next image
deleted
deleted
go to the first list item
forget
I'm gonna stop I'm gonna meet more people
when I admit something
we're not there yet with basic
speech technology in speech commands were far from ready
but with a lot of fun doing that and a lot of work way I discovered
but there is a reason why this is there a crowd there a clap with genius
you know they're a club you know the story of these two nerds walking to
their
lab Apple and Microsoft take over the world
you don't know the story went to their art lab in it like they went to Chinese
Chocolate Factory and Steve Jobs and and
bill gates are the amazing thing technology the mouse
and stop and gooey and all that other stuff and
they took over the world way I think there's a reason why the mass
so great the user interface it so it will mean it's weird
I mean I'm rolling the device or my death and the pointers moving and I
kinda from a
to really know that this is the thing the connected it weird but just works
and the key word is fantastic as well I think the reason is
that are digital are had are phenomenal
their phenomena the so flexible at a two hundred and how many muscle that work
it's just
such a great interfaith a fantastic in a feed
however good we will get with peach he will not be be
are digits in our hands we will night
but I do believe but there will be a need for us to go beyond
touchscreen when I'm wearing my watch
or wearing glasses I literally don't have a screen to touch I believe this is
the way we were going to
so we need to consider it one other thing that is really really difficult
with touched
with actually speed starring is that oftentimes when you doing speech command
it's more like
when a taxi order tackling
don't kill the cat order taxi you know and you have to basically get the whip
not the really right and just given in the right click the correct way
you know Hwy what's the weather
you know and it's very unnatural
and user interfaces they never work at their natural
you know that the tablet computers had been existed I think even a decade
before
the the job they did the next big thing
you know the problem was that the resolution for touch devices were so bad
so when Apple released their iPhone
deal with crazies period when every phone maker just through
touch at you you know but it was horrible I remember my first when I got
actually just when I joined the company became the phone with
everyone other than iPhone and the only one other phone left and I got the phone
from the for the company
and everyone is doing your touch thing in there are looking like an of
celebrities in there just
you know reveling in the Mac called and I had this phone
it was from no-name brand and you could hardly be touch it had like
3 pixel resolution in the time to the touch interface
and touched it doesn't work if it doesn't work
you need to have some Creek area in order for it to work but when the user
interface
actually would is intuitive and natural
it does really work into the problem we have with Bijan
it have to be really really natural have to be I think were to be really
mainstream
you have to be this natural in fact it has to be
have to be kinda on more like this natural
way I can arm make aren't mistakes and to like are
mumbling like that that I'm naturally to be you need to recover
wean machine learning
you this here
is a very very very valid English then tip
an order for speech commands to work you need to be able to tell me what the noun
what the verb what the adjective what the
what's the noun that the prof that the proposition and with another location
buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
Buffalo this it the full grammatical english tinted
military what it said there's a Buffalo
whose name is Buffalo who the Buffalo a buffalo
the name for something for the bully someone like to shop people around you
colombell
so there's a Buffalo whose name is Buffalo and hit the bottle
and he's from buffalo new york and what he does
the Buffaloes around other buffalo's were also
Buffalo urs in there also from Buffalo New York
your computer need to be able to understand that if it's going to be able
to understand
natural language English machine learning baby
that's what the computer needs to be able to understand
for sentence and then recursively figure out what everything means
so when I want to do my when I had the idea of doing like a
with the editor with speed I knew right at the bar you can forget this
if it's going to be go to the next paragraph
select the first word in the first paragraph cut
this word in this paragraph can be like that have to be
0 go to the first paragraph selected
make it read you have a context it'd
and you can take shortcuts that have to be like a conversation and we have to
maintain state
and you really critically have to understand literally what I'm saying
in order for it to work and so I was looking for a
job a lot JavaScript library and whoa there is no JavaScript library that
doing this
but fortunately there are people who are really working home
full time actually machine learning and linguistic technologies
for the military for things like theory and
for the future and I found a a an open source project
contact email Wed that
solve my problems all I give it a sentiment
it tells me the constituent parts and what they mean
semantically and then I take this
the Scopus people were treated and from it
I develop and instructions that and this instruction set
is given to a lower editor an elated as editing commands for me
and then I maintain state to have a conversation
so here's a couple technology that we need to know to pull this off
you need to be able to speech recognition need to be able to do
natural and would put processing command parsing
you need to do obviously editing operations the recognition
I'm using the Google API that's why there was the awkward pause when I spoke
in a kinda just like
waited and hoped it worked because we were doing that run trip to
Google servers are coming back natural ever put the thing I'm using
a program to c:\program I'll show you how you run the programs in
on a just a virtual machine a engine sorry into the second
and then I rather think addicted at which does the bulk of maintaining the
state and figuring out
so what he saying what does this mean in terms of the instructions that
the fortunate thing I discovered when I was doing this project is that English
has kinda like only for like forms of of speaking like their
on declarative the
inquisitive the
there too as I can remember and then it imperative
imperative for me when you tell someone get up from your seat lather
live or something like that it basically to command
unfortunately if you know where the computers
but you have to do with telling okay you can ask questions but in my case
I did needed to tell 'em think so I only had to work in one form which is really
really helpful
and then we had howling mad in a letter to the new editing API and
to execute this command and by the way difficult to tell you this
which you saw their know that was actually quite an editable
it was the API doing content editable but purely from
my control well just editing library the completely replace continental in fact
the cursor that you saw their was not a native cursor
was actually a did we found a way to position at anyone in the document
find a way to make it given the right height and to give it the right styling
think that you can't do like to do the right thing that you can do on
a native with the native pursued
alright you guys wanna see some code
I'm not only that they want to see the code so I bring my a-game
okay on
how to use it must be stated the technology such is going to be much
cooler stuff in his talk but I'm going to be really briefly
I did this Wed very simple
ball that it
up
you the web initialize the West WebKit speech engine
I said it to basically continuously record matter into
so that it doesn't stop and terminate after the first time it picks up my
sentence but every time I keep speaking it just keeps waiting for me to say more
and the other thing I want me to do that every time it picks up
I finished word or push for the sentence immediately send it to the server to be
processed
so by the time I finish my sentence part to the early chance have already been
process I don't have to sit there
well it's just processing along chanted
basic error handling but you can forget about
and this function call resulted
and on results we take the route we take basically the entire set on my
utterances and we process than and wat
structured is that the final result which is marked its final
contain the cumulative utterances
in one in in one cent and so
what you're into in the room is a subset is that the subsidy attorneys in index
one which is a subset
arteries an index to which is upset that that it up to get to the final which is
your full thing
and all I care about is my fourth thing so I get when a final comes in I get it
and a given II call my call back function
and when I also did is I took
okay I think you're take the transcript which is the
way here the transcript which is basically the text
what I just spoke to the machine me and there's also this really cool thing
called the confidence of the machine
basically said and you got a weird accent tho
I'm only like 50 percent sure I got this right
no which is good because basically economic enable you to Eric corrections
if it's before you like
they're probably not what he said chuck it you know and wait for him to say
something out
19 let you useful what i did i simply wrap this in a function called little
and so when I invoke the function initializes the speech recognition for
me
and take my call back function and every time he recognized me speaking is that
okay
he require function here reporting what reporting back to you what you
would what you just said do whatever you want with it because the only got 10
minutes I'm not even gonna show you how that
run you actually saw them I Demel camp
get a Wii part
running see court
with JavaScript in your browser I need to do natural language processing and
there is no jus good luck with that
there will be in the future I really believe that but there was no so where
did they use LVM which is an awesome
awesome project you can check it out online it was like I have
is waving his hand is really really awesome they're doing phenomenal work
and you can check it out when I did is
this library has anyone okay put your hands up as anyone actually used to love
the M
well alright right
some proper nerds opinion alright what does it take fecal
and it allows you basically to run he called &amp; Co and and
ITN it takes lol VM call lucky to run it on your browser
and so what you do is you can download the package was delighted to compile
your ski program
any compounded object code in a compartment LVM any compatibility
JavaScript file
its prequel let me show you
a little bit how that actually put together him
so much about your let me show you own
JavaScript the
because the problem I had actually pleasure
yeah I'm sure this the problem I had was that
see how the couple have data structures that a
just doesn't pointers and
structures we don't have those okay we have structured in terms of object but
we don't have pointers in just a bit on how you implement that
so it the library link grammar
was partially which did did the worksheets for me it relied on pointers
and
on these other district to that I didn't have so what I decided to do with you
the most basically a structure which is basically strings
but in order to do that they needed to wrap the lab with that I was using
in my own implementation which would basically abstract away all the weird
pointer stuff
so I input string and output string
because JavaScript like strings so why did
I wrote a JavaScript the file and you can look really briefly here
I mean this'll okay no one has any right
to judge my code okay this is a little
might my application with a frankenstein it was there to demonstrate something
okay you have no right to didn't record just work with me OK
so I'm on I and creating a couple a day I'm good
a couple data structures here which I initialize all
with the setup function and the reason I did
the real I did over here just because I can't think of a better place to put
them
so the dysfunction could set up and then I have a function could tear down
which are complemented each other and an important function
is this diagram function the diagram function
the function basically takes my string my a trend
go to the first paragraph or delete the image it take
this string and basically processes that with a
parsing API than the CP parking in p.a
and outcome is another string and I can use it in javascript well initially how
are you that in javascript him when I open
well as did think it's dictate
no was what the final bill
cally funded
good LOVE and
there you go but compare these
so
when a process this
inability JavaScript a on
just a program pharmacy program will happen
that whoops my setup
function in C becomes I said a function
in jobs but and there's two ways I can call the function
I can you modules in these basic
the it's the on the names with which I interface with the
with the built with a bill program I could hear you see call
which will call the function one anything that you pass into it
are the name of the function that you declared in C that you defined in the
clear DT
you pass then
the return type you pass argument types
so with this number or string
or object and then you pass actual values that you'd call
you call the function would in this case
as you can see here set up a function that takes no parameters
Wed there's another way
to you the API and that is to use this year Apple
what this does it would create
it create a javascript function would you can recall
without using this weird said
and with the Hereafter does it something very similar you specified
diagram which is on which is this function declared here
and as you can see the think the well pointed to a string
I mean characters which is basically a strain
that the return value and as you can see here the transcript is also
strange a string of characters and it's better here
and the cool things and I'm returning this I'm returning the
the a the product of this invocation
and that becomes my parser now because my apartment number assure you that
so how do I get from C code into JavaScript code
how to do that is gonna show the make file
where simple kind of him
the bare bones make file you could specify where you sort
for the C code is typical make value no to include any dependencies and we
object found to be stored at a terrible
and then you obviously need to specify the path to where you have this a
and script in which is basically the tool to build but doesn't weird
magical conversion and then
the interesting part exported function
will call so and I don't know why they do this
but you need to underscore your function that you want to export so you
you have a bunch a function you can define in your script in you you see
file
but you choose which one you want to export and thing you have to do you have
to underscore that
don't know why I didn't I don't have time to actually read up on that but you
gotta do it this way
and then you basically to the output file and the output file
actually HTML file once you actually build this project you simply open the
exhibition of our
your pro you see program lead to be running on your browser
way and the other flight which is important for me
with the pre loading a file data the pre loading a file data
was necessary for me because the the link grammar
parser written the was basically pulling resources as needed
to the Internet and I wouldn't work for me so what I needed
was to basically collect all the free all their resources and bundle them into
some like a virtual filesystem
and is what this does so when I build my project and I run into my brother
there's a big brother loader which is basically a virtual filesystem
be and then are builded
and that's pretty much it and then I include the file when a project
we're good to go think I have an index here
there I called the party s not just for Jess
all be and that's basically it
good to go
talked about that
we talked about that game
when a close up
you know
my talk is not really about
Beach comment not really the idea I want to communicate
is about how I think we should think about the continuous innovation on the
web how we can be better torch bearers
to speak in hyperbole well how basically
you we can straddle the mobile and the web divide
now we can work with the web I really believe
at the greatest value that we are developers bring
to our company's our organization our endeavors is not the code that we ride
I believe that the greatest value that we bring
in our project is an ability to take
complex problems and bill elegant model
solutions and that is true for designers developers
engineers park managers in technology we take complex problems
when we build model the solution that's basically what we're doing
in mine short career
in my experience one of the biggest wet blanket in order to do that
is the idea that you know how everything should work or the idea
that have to work this way it must be this way and two for a long time we
thought
we build a model mobile editor and we just basically have to shrink
everything I make you responsible I'm really not convinced that the case
yes we believe that tablet are gonna be huge we believe the tablet
are going to be all the way that we're gonna do digital content authoring but
I'm really not convinced
we're gonna do it on my mobile phone Wed not your stuff anyway
and we're gonna if we're gonna have solutions for those
we really need to think beyond just touch we really need to actually listen
to what's happening in a more well
a row we also need to speak to it their fragmented
we fragment aka we also more developers he was gonna its fragmented
it missing some other L'Agence or at least some other a
the good attempt to that have been that have been a attempted with the lead
but if I had a takeaway for you
got that ball
your value as an engineer the designer
the project lead intact
not in the code that we're at the pixel that we move it in your creativity
your passion and your hard work and ability to take complex product problems
bill elegant model solution thank you very much you get have been really
really
attack
