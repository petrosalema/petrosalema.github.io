summary: Future machines...
---

They say that you see your whole life flashing before your eyes the moment you
think your going to die, but that's not the way it happened with me. What I
remember was a grass... lot of grass.

As I was running for my six-year-old life, I remember the feeling of grass
rushing along my shins and we ran through the field I remember the sound of the grass as our pursuer was
coming behind us I also remember the site of the machete the landed literally
a few feet away from my uncles let me tell you what happened
true story there was this man whose girl who lives in this town where I grew up
in the man's name was working on this is a true story why killer was a notorious
local mad man I'm not talking Jon Hamm Madison Avenue the guy you see on TV mad
man I'm talking crazy I'm gonna kill you mad man it's a one day my friend and I
were walking home from preschool and walking down a tree along the fields in
Tanzania and as we walk we notice it as a gentleman walking on the road we are
on the trail is on the main road a little distance behind us and we notice
that is carrying a panga machete no problem no no big deal there a guy
walking behind you carrying a machete in Tanzania nothing to go home about except
we noticed that this man was working crazy as all get out and armed and my
genius friend decided that this was the perfect moment to provoke a Killa
so what he does if he turns around and yours Waikoloa Beach ah which means
Wauchula you nutcase and so what what it does is he set his attention on us and
this looks coming to console his face as though this seems like a particularly
beautiful day to kill me thirty six-year-old breath no kidding the guy
starts charging us with a machete and we like six year old kid that's of course
what we do is we dashed into the fields and we run as fast as our six-year-old
legs could carry are dwindling lifespans now most of us here I would guess have
never been chased by a machete-wielding madman but I would venture to guess that
every single one of us here knows the experience called fight or flight by our
flight it's that moment of amazing mental efficiency where the human
operating system on the onslaught of all these signals and streams and messages
coming in distilled innumerable variables down to a surprisingly clear
simple single binary decision put them up by our flight and in that moment we
have this mechanism in others before it even gets to our our consciousness which
determines what information in our surrounding in our context is useful to
bring it to our awareness that we have like an interface and the tension
firewall a load balancer inside your head which which tells us the smells are
the useful to these go to your attention span the sound of aggressive that you
should go to attention span memories of your homework is that useful that going
to attention span and the purpose of deciding and and and prevented from
going into attention span is to allow your attention span to be able to be
used for the maximum possibility of success in your living situation in my
episode with whitey la Madeleine jazz band was filled with grass because
that's what are stapled but the point is
kitchen is a scarce commodity in our body in our minds and we have the
inbuilt mechanism which helps us control that we don't overload capacity and so
what you experience is tunnel vision and what happened the tunnel vision is a
little bit it's a little funny your eyes dilated which actually lets in more
signals not less signals and it should be more confusing right you getting all
this light coming in on this method is applied information but at the same time
your body only let you see in this very small attention space and so all that
information that was coming in is being processed subconsciously to make sure
that there's no other dangers that need to be brought it to the attention space
but information coming into attention space is very limited why so that you
can maximize the possibility of success in that moment using the limited
capacity you have in your in your and your attention
aggressive optimizations on the basis of attention there is something that
designers and artists really get they know this and that is a tension is a
precious commodity and its 0 some attention paid in one place its
intention poverty in another and so when we're looking here at this image on the
screen are paying attention to the color of the curtains for the Lions on the
floor what we see on the screen a ballerina dancer but what you're
actually proceeding is much more information than that but that's not
useful what is useful what is interesting is a ballerina dancing were
very impressed with our body's ability to sense things and gather information
about the surroundings but we also take for granted how crucial it is that for
all the information that we are receiving a processing and we have
sensors to perceive that for any given time most of that information is ignored
it's actually a phenomenal ability it's a thinking process that happens beyond
your thinking ignoring information that's not useful now fighter flight is
an instance of an extreme situation which brings to light in a useful way
what you're doing this all the time when you go to the movies you ignore the
things that the border of the screen when you go to watch a player or a
ballet you ignore the scaffolding around the stage and you focus on the
performance when you listen to music you ignore the drowning noise of the traffic
and the chatter at the Starbucks and you listen to the music to the strings and
harmony even as I'm speaking right now you're not paying attention to the size
of the space or to the fact that you can if you listen hear your heart beating
and the sound of your breathing know those things have been filtered away so
that your limited precious attention span can be maximized so that you can
engage in with you and so all information systems have this property
that there are limited by their bandwidth and our bodies and our minds
are in it as an information system and the digital ecosystem and environment we
live in is also an information system and it has but it has a bandwidth limit
as well
technology only had its meaning and context in relationship to human beings
and as soon as a human in the Human Information System constant contact with
the digital information systems the limiting bandwidth is not what our
processing chips can do for the lag between between the signal poles are to
the server what is limiting is your attention back it is a finite commodity
you only have 24 hours in your day and you have a pretty constant amount of
processing capacity in your head so this is very important
the big idea that I want to discuss with you today is based on the notion that
attention span is a limited capacity and it doesn't scale that's what I want to
talk about is how can we in this world where we are under a burgeoning volume
of information and signals and messages and tweets and retweets and chirping and
beeping and buzzing and now tapping on your wrist how do we
maximize our attention how we do we call with a world which is going to be
exploding with more devices that are connected homes with are collected use
connected cars and when the rise of the rest happens when the rest of the world
gets on social media how we gonna possibly keep keep keep keep our sanity
under this tidal wave of information that's what I want to discuss today and
the importance I think in this is that when we're developing or designing
things were often focusing on solving the small problems in the context of our
of our project or the tools or product that we're building but by the time you
come to launch for release your work is always going to go into a bigger system
into bigger platforms and interfaces that are going to prepare it further and
for me it always is very helpful in stirring and inspiring when I look as
far above as they can on basically the entire picture and that often informs my
notion of what I'm doing our go-to-market strategy what are the
things that are the property that I should be working on and two for me this
is as far as high as I can go and as far as I can see which makes sense in the in
the direction we're going in information systems with the web with the internet
with modern technology etc and whatever what I see and I noticed is that if we
cannot manage our attention to properly there is a serious risk about falling
off a usability cliff and I want to explain it this way this is stephen
wiltshire stephen wiltshire mute in his youth at the age of 32 diagnose as
severely autistic but at the age of 32 32 he was awarded membership into the
Order of the British Empire he was a night game night at him because he was
brilliant stephen wiltshire can do something that none of us can
you can do this what mind-bending about Stevens work is that he draws
photorealistic cityscapes from a single glance and then from his memory not
postcard not photos he just has a cursory glance at the landscape he goes
into a studio and he makes these massive painting pictures it's absolutely
beautiful beautiful and amazing now what may surprise you
is the reason why Stephen can do what he can and you and i cant and it's not
because he can see better than you
it's not that he's able to perceive things better than you those who studied
the artistic and the survivors they say that we perceive just as much as Stephen
Wiltshire and they would the differences not in him having a bit and ability that
we don't have met him lacking an ability that we do have i thinkin interface that
helps him control the amount of information that goes into his attention
and that that remains in a subconscious so you're seeing a lot of things right
now but most of those remaining a subconscious and very little goes into
attention
stephen wiltshire all of that goes into the attention or most of it goes into
the tension and so he remembers it all and you see that all and when is drawing
says I'm just seeing the picture but it comes at a cost
attention is a scarce commodity if what you pay attention attention to Israel's
literally an economic transaction with returns and risks that means that it's
it's the amount of attention he's playing to receiving all these signals
about what is I see is diminishing the capacity can spend on other things
simple things like social interactions and beach things like that and so it's
really important and it's not a malfunctioning of our bodies that we
forget a lot of things and we ignore a lot of things it's actually a capacity
is kind of like a load balancing
in a faraway we literally live under a cloud cloud it's raining signals and
messages and data and I think if we're going to understand how to build
interfaces that can help us cope interfaces that are usable that don't
end up falling off a usability cliff but enable us to actually maximize our
experiences with digital devices that we need to understand a little bit of how
we actually got here and i wanna talk in in in relation to building systems and
platforms that thing for us and helping our and our conserving our tension I
want to think about the advent of notifications and its context in Moore's
Law is an observation and are fairly simple one more Gordon Moore observed
roughly speaking at the amount of computing power given to be subject of
transistors tend to double every two years
anyone was a basic understanding of math knows that the power of Moore's Law is
exponential growth what he's saying is not that computers are gonna get faster
what he's saying that computers are gonna get a lot faster a lot faster
that's the power of Moore's Law and it is it understand the math behind that
but what is utterly mind-bending and hard to grasp are the consequences
the implication of Moore's Law are really hard to to to forecast more the
law is fundamentally not about computers being able to do more things just being
faster the implication of Moore's Law is over it the changing of social protocol
because of computation of powers so because everyone has a computer in their
pocket which can locate them physically and it's constantly on and can
communicate with servers in the cloud
because you can do you have server farms we can do computations in large numbers
of people really quickly it enables you to build a service which kind of
disrupts taxi services and sharing cars so you have the perfect location of
things
implication of Moore's Law the Netflix in the television Amazon of retail the
Spotify radio these are all implications of Moore's Law is a great example of
what it means when a social protocol changes on the basis of computing and
technology consider for example the telephone number telephone number as a
as a different function today than it did twenty years ago twenty years ago
when you give someone your telephone number
essentially was an address it with an address and a vague promise that if you
would call me either at my work one location at a payphone another location
or at my home and if you call me a particular set of our we can probably
arrange a synchronization of our attention and we can have a
teleconference with you called me at 6 or 7 p.m. in the evening and you called
me a word you want finally but he called me the location at home that telephone
number you can have a conversation and if you call me around two o'clock in the
day you need to call me on the telephone that of work so we can have a
conversation there that was a senate the kind of the social protocol I give you
my number I give you access to these locations where we can then synchronize
our attention we can have dialogue entered the mobile phone and all that
changes it takes away the new location and so it's not about the protocol of
allowing people to synchronize their location and that tension essentially
when you give someone a telephone number you're giving them direct access to your
attention it's not it's not have a promise of synchronizing how you get a
teleconference to direct access to your attention and you're giving them the
implicit permission to interrupt you anyplace anytime that the application
of Moore's Law played two telephone numbers and so the implication of
Moore's laws changes produções but it also changes Megaforce Steve Jobs had
this phrase in this notion and he said that computers are like the bicycle of
them I that is we are planning a bit of course and the computers apply even more
force and therefore take us further but under the weight and implication of
Moore's Law that metaphor can start to fall apart
consider this the blue line is our retention capacity in the 50 years more
more articulated his hypothesis our attention span has remained the same I
virtually speaking it doesn't scale it doesn't grow its a finite resource at
the same time computational power is increasing in orders of magnitude
exponentially and so there comes a point in time where the computers are
processing information faster than we can actually receive them and they're
sending signals because there are optimized to communicate and send
signals and they're sending the president we can process them and we
were driving the conversation anymore it's not we were peddling if the
computers that are coming to us with questions and suggestions it used to be
the fact that we would go on to Google and search that's no longer the modem
mode of operation the information is pushed in streams and it just comes to
other notification and we've got streams and streams and streams of information
and serendipity and all these things are run by algorithms deciding what you may
like to buy you may like to talk with where you want to go eat where you want
to go travel the weather all these things are just algorithms and these
machines and these these devices these servers that has haunted with artifact
of our digital life and they're just computing on it at a faster rate than we
can handle all this information to send to us
but we are a bottleneck because they're scaling we remain constant now in the
advent of computing the way used to do it is due time sharing you would write a
program on these cars and you're taken into a room and you went to the other
guy got out and he got out and then you went in and you put your card in the
machine and then you could go do your laundry go pick up the kids to have a
coffee good whatever you want to do and then you would come back and then the
machine will be ready and he would spit out to you
the seven digit of time a day's worth of work and then you congratulate yourself
ticket taker your program you know public color of your white coat and go
do something else until tomorrow
digital Moore's Law implication that completely changed computers and
time-sharing not got much more computational power and so they wanna
tell us a lot of things they wanted to tell us what to buy because that's what
are optimized for that one of those what to look at because there are optimized
to advertise but we can't handle it all and so they sent us a message and
they're kind of waiting are we going to retweet that in the meantime there
crunching numbers on the social graph and on weather and if the weather report
and wonder whether we're going to follow the link and buy a new umbrella there
waiting for us to interact but now it's done waiting on us not us waiting on now
implication of of of Moore's law changes protocol to change the metaphors we
think about in computing
and because the devices are with us all the time because their group their their
their power increases exponentially and because they're they're on all the time
the stream of consciousness from the computer to us constants and as human
beings we communicate with one another through messages you can say that's the
token of our communication with computers communicate communicate with
us to notifications that's like the token of their communication computer
study says that on average we received sixty notifications had a 68 you haven't
got your smart connected shoes a smart connected car yet I don't know how many
of you have a nest in your home talk to you we're facing a usability clash with
regard to our attention to what do you do when you realize that you build
altering the biggest gamble that ever been created is not a person not even a
company it is just the internet this system and its gonna kill switch right
and it wants to communicate with you and it's gonna throw you off a usability
clip what do you do you cannot go back that's not an option
technology doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way you cannot just
turn off all your notification they tried that you can't commit Facebook
suicide
well you can but somalia gonna pop up and some other social network
sooner or later a friend of mine is telling me home how insecure and stupid
credit card was and asked him to use a credit card is the job of course going
back and I really an option you can forgive the creation of atomic weapons
but we can never forget how to split and Adam what's past is past what do our
bodies do
when we're in the threat of being over from flooded with information more than
we can process what do our bodies do they think before that we think they
process information for us and the harness our complete the computational
power that enable our commenting system to help us reduce the law which is the
lowest I get a glass of water so they help us reduce the load by doing
actually more work harder so I did this experiment with a few days ago I was
sitting with a young lady for coffee and talk about this and it's been my
experience that switching my notifications off notifications just off
was rather cruda didn't really work what would happen is when I would come back
on twenty phone it would just be like a tidal wave of information coming out but
anyway what I did when we're sitting over coffee they did an experiment I put
my phone on the table and put it on silent and I basically SAT there with my
arms crossed and I said let the world burn
I'm not picking up the phone as I had this conversation and in a few a few
minutes later half an hour later to pick up my phone and I look and this is what
I found there I think you can see that right and they're not all the messages
that came under even there even more stacked up your buddies were all the
notifications ahead and this for me is noise it's not information when the
capacity when the amount the volume of signals coming through a channel exceed
the capacity of that channel which you come up with you end up with his noise
and what's missing here is higher key I don't know what's more important and
either I can be sitting sitting across the table and acting autistic looking at
my phone if looking at it and taken care of taken great care of my notifications
and information coming to my phone or I can sit there and basically follow for
usability click the next time I use my phone I don't know if my house is
burning down I don't know someone is an emergency at home I don't know if I got
an important message coming up work I don't know anything until I dig myself
out of that mess but then if you look a little closer here you can see what
possibilities exist for how the system can be improved
what are the messages he done here than it is a notification I got from Yahoo
telling me that they they're doing some maintenance scheduling ok so I'm ideal
world across the table with his friend and we both are smart phones with
Bluetooth the theoretically this force could communicate with one another and
now we're sitting sitting next to each other on the table the phones I have a
GPS and they'll have wifi so theoretically they can know that was
sitting in a cafe and we are also friends on Facebook
theoretically a system cannot wear two friends sitting in a cafe next to each
other
do I wanna know about Yahoo's maintenance schedule no I don't
definition doesn't need to come to my consciousness at this moment so get rid
of that water is telling me about Mother's Day get rid of that I'm trying
to have a coffee and conversation I don't need to know about that
telling me about their new feature that come out that came out get rid of that
would you do with these notification you kill them and maybe you group them and
you snooze them and when my phone realizes that have come back home and at
seven o'clock at night and I'm alone maybe that's when you bring these
trivial information to my my my awareness and that way you have you seen
before falling off a usability clip when I was in the cafe but in order to do
that you need to know what's important to me and what not important to me and I
had a friend at that same time sending me a Bible verse to encourage me
anything i text messages to tell me that he sent me the email
now situational awareness I'm sitting here in the cafe with this lovely friend
I'm not going to suddenly go on millennial on her and put my smartphone
is start quoting scripture while I'm sitting in a cafe I should be talking
with her right and so this information can be queued up and wait for my quiet
time in the evening when a more relaxing on my own and I can read through these
things that could have also gone most of these notifications actually should have
been there should never have come up maybe my house was burning and
happenstance there should have been an alert but aside from that I should have
been able to keep my my notifications on and still not have fallen into this
usability clip of these things actually I think so far out there
the technology actually exists to do this it's just that we need assistance
in the protocol to pull it off what would it take what would it take to have
my phone bank for me what would it take to build an interface that helps me
think rather than an interface that is draining me more information
identity to know me much better than it actually does really does my father
flight reflex kicked in when we're close coming at me and it quickly and
efficiently because internally whatever that logical system is in my body it
knows my secrets it knows my fears and it knows my hopes that I wanna go home
and see mom my six-year-old I don't to be hacked to death but when information
is coming into our phones all it has is just parameters contact parameters and
they're coming from disparate silos and there are just being displayed on our
phones kind of agnostic Lee and not based on identity I just want to read
this because it was so this for me was so spot-on Rebecca car
the first company to fully execute on embedding your identity into your phone
making it truly a first-class experience when the next decade Rebecca Cox said
this 2011 I recall that wasn't brilliant it's brilliant because you're talking
about what she thinks is Alexa Google and it's brilliant because of how to
define the identity surprise you this is how she defines what identity is not
this is not a density this is what your phone has but this is not identity your
password you to access your calendar
location you even your user account and let your identity and your identity what
is identity is not what it's how how of what how you manage your attention this
is your digital identity what does that mean well theoretically we can have the
exact same Twitter followers even if it was possible have almost exact same
handle and would still be completely different people how well it's because
of our relationship with all those people with whom were in contact with on
Twitter it's how we relate with one another it where r tension goals in what
times in what context so those who get my attention during my work time are my
work colleagues regardless of whether they weren't for my company Gentex for
the word for the extra bank don't get my attention when we're at home and made
dinner table are very likely my family or close friends which India will call
family anyway so it's calling family
attention is not just a bunch of data and it's not a technical achievement he
says your identity is how you manage your attention if someone or
if a system would emerge which allowed us to program or encode the mechanism
that we would like to manage our attention that a serious killer app and
that's how you Steve Dave off the tidal wave apocalypse signals a notification
it's really clever as it has it has profound implications and so what's
needed in order for us to embed identity and/or devices the best place to
embedded anything or devices in the operating system
why is that was because of the applications on their own only concede a
subset of our functionality and who we are so there's a reason why it's not my
idea makes a decision what my hand up and it's not it's not like my told you
make my decision of what my either we have a central operating system
somewhere which collates all this information and then based on my
identity based on the things that I want to do the things that I fear it then
decides where and what information comes into my attention back to the best place
to embed identities actually on the operating system and if you look behind
behind here as you can see almost every single one of these ads is a different
one and they don't share information very clearly this year some parameters
but they don't share that they don't share my identity
what if the operating system could gauge my identity and collected messages and
even real right some of these notifications and decides to show me
discard or snooze things automatically based on where my attention should be
place based on who I am this is
these players are really big advantage because they have operating systems but
you're not discounted you got a platform so Facebook for example they they know
that they know that they're not an operating system but they've got a
massive amount of user data what they try to do with the Facebook home which
is essentially kind of like a takeover of your operating system but that didn't
work but what is proving very successful is taking it over using a platform their
messaging platform and they were very serious about taking away their
messaging up and making it a single stand-alone application so that now they
can use their messaging app as essentially a separate runtime on top of
the top of your phone system and what does allow them to do is eventually
they're now controlling your attention street and they can serve up information
to you information to you collect data and they can control what's coming to
you and that's very valuable so you don't have to be an operating system
that does this you can even be a platform once you've enabled the
platform to no information about your interests and your attention this creep
factor privacy is a misalignment of view of of a user interface where we feel
that we're giving so much of our information over to these systems and we
don't there's not enough of a transparency as to what as to what
happened with that information and so when you talk about giving your identity
over to your devices into and to cloud services it has asked has a script
factor what are they gonna do with my formation what if your information
which is a new form of digital wealth actually that these companies are
sitting on what if this information was truly your possession when you go to a
doctor you don't go to one doctor and the doctor is on silent for example when
you log into Google you on that log into Facebook or log into Twitter each one of
those at their own silos and you can take information from one cell phone to
another when you go to a doctor
imagine if your entire medical history had no consequence and it just took at
face value
know you want to be able to take all that medical history and bring it to
bear in the situation
banks work in a similar way just because the bank has your your well that doesn't
mean that they own it because they can use it but it's still yours so what if
our user information was something that really belong to us and they were
protocols and systems to ensure that but we can offer it to Facebook offered to
Twitter offered to the to the net application that coming along and we can
choose what information we choose to share with whom and that information
belongs to us and we can also audit how this information is used in order to
target US and transmit information to us what if information was truly are
property that would take the creep factor a little bit away from the idea
of sharing more information in order to better identity
but all of these things in themselves will not scale so there's two paradigms
in essentially two programs and software development one is embodied by Steve
Jobs and was invited by allen keys to Steve Jobs paradigm is the product
paradigm that operate on its way you create politics and polish products and
you offer them at a premium and it's great you get great software and you get
great technology that way but it separates the distance between the
developer and the consumer by big deal but in doing so you create a market and
in doing so you're to create one of the most lucrative companies in the world
users however are not able to reason very well about how this product on me
you're not able to just crack something open and hack it but there is Alan case
paradigm and that paradigm is the hacker paradigm it's less products more Lego
and Alex case has grand vision that essentially programming would just be
literacy at the same way that you learn mathematics even though you're not a
banker a mathematician but you know how to do it when you needed in the same way
programming is something that everyone be able to do why is this important
building interfaces and systems and platforms that think well there is a
limit to how much people in Palo Alto can reason about my life in Vienna there
is a limit and reason about all the ways and the different system difference mode
in which I want to use their software and if I have to wait for every new
release every time I want to better adapt with it with information that
flowing into my life that's not very scalable but what if writing computer
programs was much simpler what if instead of just being able to do
configurations and filters we can actually alright filters which have
logic in them I think it had a grand vision and there was one of the reasons
why he came up here
help develop object oriented programming the ideal object oriented programming
with a take the current concepts lameta force that the people were familiar with
in that existed and translate this into programming now I personally don't like
object oriented programming one of the worst thing that you can deal with in
programming estate and the last thing you want is your state to be scattered
and that's what i dooo orientation does but the idea behind it as phenomenon
everyone is a programmer and so allen keys he's he's requesting money from the
government to start this kind of like initiative which is about reinventing
programming and making programming something that is accessible to everyone
and so you've taken away silos taken away the creep factor of privacy and
you've taken away the barrier of entrance for those who don't know
programming so that they can adapt systems in my system that can help them
pay attention rather than having a dictator to them and so you can imagine
that you have an operating system where apps are so are are are not necessarily
push notifications but floating notifications in a given format to see
for example this is a photo you know and it was taken at this time it was sent to
this person and you have a format for transactions of format for events of
format for meeting acquaintances and these formatter open and use format are
served into the operating system or the platform and you can ride filters and
you can write subroutines on these platforms which are simple but allow you
to group information and to decide for example listen I'm sitting at a cafe if
I'm sitting at a cafe and the messages coming from work then ignore it and
let's maybe I'm very particular our with a particular person but you could simply
write that on a platform are operating system and that could control the amount
of the speed and the timing of the messages that came to you it's an idea
one of the hardest things to grasp about Moore's Law is its implications in an
article that was written at the time of the celebration of the fifty years of
Moore's Law the point that they hit in the article is that they said that when
you build it let's say you're you're developing a feature of products and
you're targeting to release it in about a year if you're building it with the
assumption and technology of today sooner or later that pattern Moore's Law
is going to prove that when you launch your gonna be already out of date one of
the hardest application to grasp of Moore's Law is that the things that are
seemingly impossible today by the time we're launching will be possible so what
today are some of the assumptions connectivity the fact that every single
requires you to sign in with your identity
pretty much on your phone identity is a lair in software your information is
always going to be on the cloud connectivity just gonna be rampant in
your phones and your devices are essentially just thin clients there are
