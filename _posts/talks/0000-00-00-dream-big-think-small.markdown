summary: A heuristic for appraching big challenges
---
Petro Salema.
Their pilots were dropping from the sky like fruit flies.
And it was the job of the engineers
to do something to save their lives.
The British Royal Air Force in World War II
were suffering such massive losses of their bombers
that they gathered a team of engineers
on what was essentially a
technical rescue mission.
They had a problem, a usability problem.
Is this mic bothering you as much as it's bothering me?
Is it OK?
If it's OK just nod really loudly.
If it's not I'll get some tech to sort me out.
It's OK?
I think it's my coat.
Can we take a moment to just sort me out?
Because it's bothering me a little bit.
I can take off the shirt, it that's OK.
It's all right?
All right, let me-- OK.
I'm going to do a wardrobe change.
OK?
So hang on.
So their bombers were dying in ridiculous numbers.
And the engineers were going to be the ones who 
will save their lives.
The RAF gathered their smartest engineers.
And this technical mission was going
to be to solve a usability problem.
You see their bombers,
marvelous pieces of engineering
that they were, terrible weapons of destruction 
that they were, fantastic pieces of engineering.
But under enemy fire they
had crippling security
vulnerability.
And so they called
in the engineers.
When your users are
dying on your systems,
you've got a usability problem.
So the engineers came
in, and these engineers
came up against what is a common
restraint of all airplanes.
You see in order to better
armor the airplanes, essentially
what they would have to
do is add weight, armor.
But the more armor they
would add to these airplanes,
the worse they would fly.
And so there was a delicate
balance that they had to play.
How much armor were
they going to add,
and how would they add
this armor in such a way
that the planes were both
capable to do their destruction
and able to be prevented
from being destroyed?
It wasn't revenue
on the balance.
When they lost a user,
they lost a countryman.
If they lost this enterprise,
if their team failed,
they lost a country,
and they lost Europe.
But these engineers,
they had a plan.
They had an approach, analytics.
What they did is that
they gathered data.
All the planes that came in,
they looked at everywhere
where there was flag
damage, everywhere
where there was bullet
damage, anything
that was wrong with the planes
that came back from the front.
And they gathered all
this data, and they
did a statistical analysis.
And a pattern began to emerge.
It was obvious
where these planes
that were coming back from the
war were getting hit the most.
And with the information
being so clear
using analytics, the answer
and the solution just
answered itself.
It was obvious.
What they had to do is not have
to armor the entire airplane.
They didn't have to
armor up everything.
What they just needed to do
was to cover those areas which
were most susceptible
to enemy fire,
and their airplanes would
be minimally armored,
but perfectly secure, or
at least better secured.
The answer, through
analytics, was given to them.
And it was obvious.
It was obvious, and
it was dead wrong.
There was a statistician a
mathematician on the group,
however, a man by the
name of Abraham Wald.
Abraham Wald seeing
these exact same figures,
these exact same charts,
and exact same data
came to the exact
opposite conclusion.
He argued and
reasoned like this.
He said, these airplanes
made it back from the fight.
That means it doesn't
matter how full of holes
these airplanes are,
those holes were not
enough to take
these things down.
He argued that if you
see an airplane wing that
is full of bullets,
what that should tell
you is that bullets in an
airplane wing are not fatal.
He reasoned thus.
He says, it is exactly those
areas in our statistical models
that are pristine that
are pure and perfect,
it is those areas of planes
which must mean that when
both airplanes were
hit in that area
they never made it back home.
And thus, they never entered
the statistical model.
It was so counter-intuitive,
it just happened to be correct.
What you see at play
with these engineers
is something that is
called accessibility bias.
Accessibility bias
is where the things
that you've experienced in
hindsight limit and effect
and set boundaries on
the things that you're
able to foresee in the future.
So your hindsight
limits your foresight.
Why is this so important?
Well, as engineers, as
designers and developers,
our core task is
problem solving.
Yes.
Design at its core is problem
solving, using form and balance
to bring about a solution.
And we solve problems
by asking questions.
An accessibility bias limits
the questions you can ask.
You won't get a better answer
than the question you can ask.
Innovation happens when you
stop looking for answers
to the questions
you've been asking,
and you start asking
the right questions.
Innovation happens when you
stop looking for solutions
to the problems that you've
been running in circles about,
and you finally start
solving the right problems,
and solve all the things
that we have to deal with,
of all the burdens and
all the things that
come against this as we're
trying to essentially bring
about a future, a
user experience.
I think nothing is more
limiting, and nothing harder
to overcome than
accessibility bias.
Why?
Because you can't
escape your experience.
And your experiencing is
limiting your perception,
and it's limiting the
questions you can ask.
Accessibility bias, you
can't ask a better question
than what-- you can't
get a better answer
than the question you can ask.
Have you ever wondered why it
is that when we think and talk
and hype about
the next big thing
that next big thing is
usually an extrapolation
or an exaggeration of the last
big thing, accessibility bias.
Have you ever considered
how it is that the biggest
client, the gorilla in the room,
the guy with the loudest voice,
it doesn't matter how awkward,
how idiotic that feature
request is, it will somehow
find its way in that roadmap,
accessibility bias.
It is those bugs which have
the most complaint that
will get the urgent
treatment, even if they're not
critical to improving your
product, accessibility bias.
I recall our team leader,
our CTO at Gentex,
the company I work for.
He once was in a
stand-up meeting
which we do every morning.
And he basically told us this.
He said, just because you're
not receiving bug reports
in that feature or that
product, is no indication
that that product or that
feature is working properly.
In the worst case
scenario it just
may mean that you built
an irrelevant feature.
So we have two roads.
This road is the one
that we architected.
We planned, had coffee,
argued, bickered,
and we architected and
astronauted this road.
We mapped it out.
We paved it.
We paved the way of the future.
Users will walk
here and bless us.
This is what they did.
And so we got no complaints
about how sucky our road was,
about how horrible it is
to walk on our pavement,
because it was like
slushy and it was uneven,
and there was things
to trip you up.
We got no complaints.
But we built an
irrelevant product.
But we're smarter than this.
So what we do in software
is we booby-trap everything.
We're in war.
So those engineers
will use analytics,
so we can detect when
users run errant,
and go doing weird things.
And this way we can
discover our product,
rather than try
to just invent it.
But we're still subject to our
experiences and our biases.
We will be optimizing,
arguing, and working
on aligning our architected path
with this organic development
that we've been able
to discover with data.
And we'll be doing
this optimization
until one day we will turn
our heads and look to the sky,
and we'll see people
flying with jet packs.
And we completely
missed that boat.
Analytics in themselves
will not save us.
Analytics do not
invent the future.
We need more than data.
You see, it's not that
we don't see it coming.
It's just that every time
innovation really, really
arrives it always seems
to catch us off guard.
It's part of the thrill
of actually what we do.
We're always being surprised.
It's like, oh innovation in the
future just caught up with us.
And it snuck on us by surprise.
Why is that?
Well I think it's because
real innovation doesn't happen
in these well-articulated
grand visions and dreams
of the future.
It actually happens
in the back waters,
in the dark room where
the hacker is hacking away
on a dream, and
solving what seems
to be like idiotic problems.
So if you want to
know, and you want
to be on the crest of the
invention of the hoverboard,
don't go to hoverboard fest,
or flying machine conference.
Go find the guy who's
making the best leaf blower.
We can dream of hover packs,
hoverboards, time machines,
holograms.
It's not that we lack
a vision of the future.
Innovation happens when we're
able to bring capabilities
to bear.
We continue and
we must dream big.
But to be practical and
to realize a future,
we have to think small.
We all know of a lot of
companies, a lot of the titans
who made this
consumer technology
world that we live in.
And we all see
their sordid history
of all the mistakes
and misfortunes
that they left behind.
There are few times in
technology revolutions
where something comes that
is such a paradigm shifter.
The desktop GUI was
one of these moments.
But the story of the
desktop GUI is also a story
of Xerox's missed opportunity.
Because it was in
Xerox's part where
they invented the desktop
GUI that became so prevalent.
And it was the desktop GUI,
the desktop system that motif,
which basically was the killer
app of the PC revolution.
And it was the desktop
which gave birth
to the internet, and the
browsers, and the browsers
to the apps.
Xerox had this capability,
but dismissed it.
They dismissed the capability
as an errant hacker's experiment
in the lab.
And they continued
making copiers.
And along came these two
nerds, Jobs and Gates,
and they changed the world.
We've got to have
big dreams, but we
can't miss those small things.
I don't know how many
of you know of DEC.
But they paved the
future as well.
But this is a true statement.
This is what the
founder of DEC said.
He dismissed PCs.
They saw the capability.
But it didn't fit into
their accessibility bias,
into their perception of how
things were going to work like.
What they couldn't imagine
was how this capability will
affect the user experience.
That is where-- that is
where the divide was,
and so they dismissed it.
But don't think that
the man was an idiot.
He also had keen insight years
later, and into the world
that we'll be living in today.
Now you see this quote by him.
"People will get tired of
managing personal computers,
and will want instead
terminals, maybe windows."
He was seeing a
vision of the future.
You see the DEC conglomerate
was making mainframes.
And so that's how they
missed the PC revolution.
But here, years
later, he's seeing
of this vision of the future.
And he's saying,
people will get tired
of these personal computers.
OK.
We missed that boat.
They're going to get tired
of these personal computers.
And what they're going to
want is these terminals
and these windows.
And we're like, well that's not
a-- no-- that's not what we're
doing, terminals and windows.
But, OK.
I'm going to change
some words a little bit
here, and see what
happens to this sentence.
People will get tired of
managing personal computers,
can't carry them around.
You have to reboot
them every time
you want to check your email.
Instead they'll
want mobile clients.
And their windows to the
world will be their browsers.
You see he was able to
envision the future.
But there's no way at
that time that he would
have a roadmap for the future.
It is this great man
who made this quote.
And he said, "the
best way to predict
the future is to invent it,"
Alan Kay, a brilliant man.
There are a few people who can
probably get away with a quote
like.
That but this guy invented
object-oriented programming,
whether you like it or not.
He's the guy who actually also
pioneered the desktop GUI.
I also hear that he's a
professional jazz guitarist.
He can lead an orchestra.
And he plays something
like a pipe organ.
So he's probably
a better version
of a human being
than most of us.
And he says, you can
predict the future.
You've just got to invent it.
But what I see in history is
that these companies invented
these capabilities, and they
mispredicted the future.
It's like they missed it.
But they had the
capabilities lying there
until hackers and nerds
came by, and took it.
We've got to dream big.
But we can't miss
the small things.
And so what I would like
to say, what I would humbly
challenge us and
have you interrogate,
is the notion that it's not
our job to invent the future.
That is far beyond
your pay grade.
But it is our job, and it is
within our grasp to enable it.
We do that by harnessing
capabilities, inventing
capabilities on top
of capabilities,
discovering capabilities,
and using capabilities
and exploiting them to
the purpose of developing
the future, future
user experience.
Because whenever we're
building a user experience
for our future, we're
imagining a future
that will be
replayed by thousands
and thousands of users,
hopefully millions of users.
So we take capabilities.
We look at what is small.
We solve these small
problems, and we deliver
them to enable the future.
Inventing the future is
beyond our pay grade.
I think a pretty
good example of this
is the fruit company in
California called Apple.
This is a quote by
the late Steve Jobs.
And he basically said
early on, he says,
when we came up with
these personal computers,
we had to wait on them.
Watts and I we're having fun.
We built these
things that we loved.
But we couldn't
imagine what people
were using these things for.
We couldn't imagine owning up.
We didn't have a
roadmap of the future.
But here we are, we enabled it.
But what he did
see, his insight,
he said that he recognized
that something special happened
the moment the
computer was not being
used by a group of people, but
was used in a personal way.
When the computer became
a personal computing tool,
he said that he recognized
it in that moment something
special happened.
And it was this capability which
he built his company around,
and innovated on, and
experimented with,
the personal computer.
We dream big, but we don't
have a roadmap for the future.
We just have capabilities
lying all over the place,
and tools for which we can
build better capabilities.
We build these capabilities.
We see what happens.
We enable the future.
So one thing, a
couple of things I
just want to get across
with my message today.
Number one, the goal of
all technical innovation
is always, always, always,
always the human experience.
It has been said, computing
is not about computers.
Computing is about people.
The end goal is a
human experience.
And you've got to
bear in mind how
complex the human experience
is, especially how complex it
is in group dynamic.
Innovation is about
harnessing capabilities.
It is more so about
harnessing capabilities
than articulating grand
statements about the future.
Dream big.
We must.
Revolutionaries demand dreams.
We need to dream big, but
we've gotta think small.
Google's mission
statement is to organize
the information of the world,
and to make it universally
accessible.
That's a big dream.
How did that dream
become a reality?
It was the World Wide Web.
I don't see how
Google would have
been able to execute on this
mission statement had there
not been a capability to
basically essentially do
information organization
through crowd-sourcing.
With the internet, the
computers were connected.
With the World Wide Web
we were given usability
to connect to this internet,
and to share information.
And so what Google
didn't have to do
is knock on every
one of our doors
with their street car
parked outside our gates,
asking us for us to
share our diaries,
to share our
emails, our letters,
to share our company reports.
No.
Because of the World Wide
Web, we offer these things up
into the cloud.
And what Google had to do was
gather this and organize it,
using computational power.
Who would've road-mapped that
a military experiment followed
by scientist and genius, but
I would argue small protocols
that he developed in
Europe, would enable such
a big dream where the
information of the world
can be made accessible?
I want to see a show of hands.
Who here knows of m-pesa?
All right.
I see some hands up.
I see some hands up.
That's good.
I thought I'd see
some more hands up.
Well today you'll know a
little bit about m-pesa.
My parents traveled to
Tanzania, my home country,
and they basically
paid for their flights.
They were going all
over the country.
And they were just paying for
flights and buying things,
not through a bank, not
through ATMs, but just
through their mobile phones.
m-pesa is peer-to-peer
money transfer.
And it's really, really viral
and popular in East Africa.
And now it's going
on to the Middle
East and other countries.
m-pesa brings the dream
of a cashless society
and peer-to-peer money
transactions into a reality.
How did this happen?
What was the road map to this?
It was SMS.
And who would have
seen that coming?
m-pesa works with SMS.
So when you exchange money,
you're essentially exchanging
information the same
way you do SMS's.
What they had discovered,
actually, the same way
that you discover a path when
you have built a pavement
and you discover a
path on the grass,
is that they had discovered that
people were actually sharing
with each other their air time.
Air time is expensive
in East Africa.
They haven't set up
all the infrastructure
and it was expensive.
So people were sharing
air time with their less
well-to-do cousins or friends.
And so they saw that
there was already
an economy that had developed
out of this capability,
a new user experience
was happening,
and a whole economy
had been formed.
And so they actually,
what they did
is they harnessed this
economy, and they actually
protocoled it.
And they developed this
thing called m-pesa.
This is a grand-- this is
kind of like a grand dream.
In the developing world people
are doing peer-to-peer money
transfer with their
mobile phones.
I'm still waiting for that here.
Don't die on me.
Wake up.
When I was growing up in
Tanzania, in high school
that was about the time when
cellular telephones came out.
And so some of the rich
kids in the school, not I,
had these mobile telephones.
But then after-- in a
short period of time,
everyone had mobile telephones.
And something
really, really great
happened, something
that was just
such an instructive moment
for me to experience,
something which
we called beeping.
I want another show of hands.
Who knows what beeping is?
What?
OK.
That's interesting.
You guys know what beeping is.
For those who don't
know what beeping is,
beeping is hacking
the capability out
of-- hacking the heck out
of a mobile phone, hacking
the heck out of like the
telecom, and the air time,
actually.
What you do with beeping
is you do miss-calling
as a way of communicating.
It's kind of like-- you know
how Chinese characters are
like dense with meaning?
And beeping is like Morse code.
But each beep is like
dense with meaning.
You've got to like
decode it based
on your relationship with the
person who miss-called you,
and what's going on,
and what's your context.
You decode the beep, and you
figure out what's going on.
So this is how it would happen.
This is how it would play out.
Me and my friend, we're
going to meet up somewhere.
And we all got very little
credit on our phone.
We may actually not have
any credit on our phone.
Somehow cell phones got
cheap, everyone got one.
But air time is still expensive.
So we got these mobile
devices with this capability
to basically signal
to each other.
But we got no money.
So what are we going to do?
We're going to hack the
heck out of this thing.
What we're going
to do is when he
arrives there, whoever is first
to arrive at our destination,
miss-calls the other guy.
And when the other guy
sees the missed call,
in this social context,
with this relationship
I have with that guy and
in what we're about to do,
I recognize that what
this guy is telling
me is he has arrived.
It's only one beep, right?
And so the unofficial protocol
is that how I respond,
I send an affirmation,
an AK, and that
is a return beep, just
one, one return beep.
One return beep
signals to this guy
that oh, I got your message.
I'm on the way.
Everything's OK.
If I send two beeps,
it means I'm on my way
but I'm running late, man.
So just chill.
If I send three beeps, it
means I'm having trouble.
But I can't call you.
So if you've got
credit, call me,
or we have to
re-plan this thing.
The cellular companies,
after a while,
started seeing that
these anecdotes were
all over the place.
And so they must have looked at
their analytics and their data,
and been thinking Tanzanians,
are they so impatient?
They give you like three
seconds to pick up?
And so I learned from my
friends who were still
back home that what they
did is that they have now
commodified this.
So you have to pay even to beep.
It's become a feature.
They did not roadmap
this user experience.
They could not envision
a user experience
where people invent their
own signaling language
using mobile telephones.
You're supposed to speak
through our mobile telephones.
Text messaging is
a hack in itself.
Beeping, how do
you road map that?
How do you predict
a society would
develop that kind of
frugal way of communicating
on this platform?
All they did is they
gave us the capabilities.
We decide what the human
experience is like.
They fortunately were
able to capitalize on it.
Just one quick short story.
I had these friends, an English
guy and a Danish guy, Danish
or Dutch.
And we were together in Tanzania
and then we went to university.
And when the World Cup happened,
or some English football match,
they still had this-- this
culture of beeping one another.
Because they were cheap.
And so when someone
scored a goal,
they would beep the other guy,
like a kind of way to spite
them, like an elbow to the rib.
But what the other guy would
do to spite the other guy back,
is that when they saw
a goal happen and it
was their side
that got scored on,
they would basically be on
the ready with their phone.
And as soon as
that guy rang, they
would basically
answer to get the guy
to incur international
call cost.
So that's where you
have a hack on a hack.
All right.
We live in a world that
is like never before
mediated by the technology.
This is like never before
buzzing, blinking and beeping,
ever on, ever present,
and ever connected.
There hasn't been
a time like this.
I believe that it will be
written in the history books
that it was the 
that every company became
a tech company, computers and
human beings, user experience.
We no longer do computing
in computer rooms.
We do computing all the time.
I'm computing right now
with my mobile phone.
It's supposed to be
keeping track of my time.
But I forgot to switch it
on so, the 
I got 
Excellent.
All right.
But we're computing
all the time.
It's no longer a
matter of productivity.
Computing mediate
our lifestyles.
And then not only does it
mediate our lifestyles,
it's mediating and
shaping our culture.
That leads me to ask
a couple of questions.
But there's one thing I
want to point out first.
If more of our life is being
mediated by technology,
what does it mean for those
who do not have access
to these capabilities?
What happens to those
who by their misfortune
or by physical difficulty
or mental handicap,
don't have access
to this bounty?
I believe it's one of our--
it's part of our moral duty
to actually bring
capabilities and usability
and accessibility in such a
way that the most will benefit.
And I think, in part, that is
why we are here, to share idea,
to speak into our
biases, and hopefully
to bring this thing
to more people.
But it also means
something else.
Culture, culture is an
extremely difficult thing
to put your finger on.
None of us here can pull
off Pharrell Williams' hat.
We're not culture
makers like that.
Culture is a very difficult
thing to put your finger on.
So if you thought it was
hard in the past when people
had to walk into computer
rooms to predict the future,
how are we supposed
to predict culture?
How are we supposed to program
culture, codify culture,
algorithm culture?
We're supposed to reason about
the technical difficulties
we have with algorithms
and programs?
We're supposed to reason now
about people's lifestyles?
OK.
Designers, we're
already onto this.
Lifestyle and all that
sort of stuff, designers
are clued up about this.
But now this is going full
stack, engineers and developers
as well.
Not only are we
supposed now to reason
about lifestyle in
computational terms,
we're supposed to reason about
culture in computational terms.
We got memes and LOL-ing,
and all manner of texting.
The dream gets bigger.
But it also becomes, in
a sense, more fragile.
Because technology mediates
so much more of our lives
that rubber is meeting the
road so much more often,
and friction becomes
felt much more.
If I'm using your
piece of software,
your future user experience
that you developed,
and this experience
is cumbersome,
but I need to use it
every hour of my life
that's starts to
be a real problem.
So the challenge and the
burden of getting it right
is critical.
UX is mission critical.
It is innovation critical.
It is future critical.
Getting the human experience
right in computation
is very important.
I can't leave the
computer room and escape
your horrible design.
It's in my pocket all the time.
What this does is it makes
capabilities not something
that we do so that we can
just enable the future.
But it becomes something that
we do as a feature in itself.
We no longer-- well, users
are no longer interested
in your product or
your massive framework
or your application
or your applications.
What they're interested
in, is a superpower.
When I install that app, or
when I download that browser
extension, I'm shopping
for a superpower.
I'm shopping for an augmentation
to my life, to my lifestyle.
The manner in which
I use the technology
and these capabilities,
however, is up to me.
And so the job of UX is to
fine-tune the capability
and bring it and
deliver it to the user
in the most fine-tuned and
human-friendly way possible.
It is not our job to
bring the user to us,
and have them do time-sharing
on our big mainframe program.
What we do is time-sharing
within their life.
So my phone knows to
dim itself at night.
It knows to ring less loudly
at this particular hours
of my day.
It makes it much harder
to solve our problems.
But we've got to
solve them right.
We see this happening
now all over the place.
Apps are fragmenting and
focusing on their features.
And we see some of the
best apps that we have,
and some of the best--
and some of the best
softwares on the
web, are those which
focus on delivering capability.
Dropbox is a fantastic example.
One of the titans of our-- one
of the greatest industrialists
of our times, he dismisses
Dropbox as a feature,
and not a product, but
man what a feature.
It is the capability
that I need.
And I will shape my lifestyle.
I don't need a product.
I need a feature.
So we don't build capabilities
and harness capabilities only
to invent these big
monolithic systems.
Those capabilities
are our products.
It is what we're doing.
So I want to close and explain
to you a little bit what
my experience has been with
our vision of user experience,
and the challenges that we had.
And it's part of the
things that shaped
my thinking about this problem.
I've been working
for a couple of years
in the esoteric realm of the
web called content editing.
Content editing is a hot mess.
Browser vendors,
I'm looking at you.
Much of the web is
images and text.
But the capabilities to edit
those two things together,
to work with those two things
together, is horrendous.
But we have a big dream
about building capabilities
for people to make great
things for the web,
to marry text and images
and content in a way that
is really compelling.
You see, images
aren't going away.
They're so visceral
and powerful,
and say a thousand words.
But text isn't
going away either.
Language isn't going away.
Symbolic systems
are not going away.
And so our vision, our mission,
is to bring capabilities
to the web that will allow
people to basically create
editing experiences that will
allow people to basically make
great content.
But we had a problem
in contenteditable,
because contenteditable,
like I said, is a hot mess.
And we spent a lot of time
working on this space.
And this year we
had a breakthrough.
We were finally able to
rethink whether we needed
to use contenteditable,
which is a-- who
knows what contenteditable is?
It's actually a-- OK.
Very good.
Thank you.
It's actually-- its
an attribute in HTML
which allows you to
basically transform
your element into something that
is writable, not just readable.
Wake up.
Stay there.
OK.
So we had this breakthrough.
But it requires us to
really think small.
And the thing that we had
the breakthrough with--
and this is just a small
example of capabilities
coming in unexpected places.
The breakthrough came with
the caret positioning.
And you see here I've
got this wonderful,
not blinking but dancing, caret,
just to bring home a point.
We wanted basically to lift
the capabilities of content
editing, and bring
them to the user space,
so that we can
build a better API.
So that we can
build capabilities,
so that people can
build their own editors.
One of the big problems we
had-- and for a long time
we thought it was impossible
to escape contenteditable,
and we thought we
were trapped in it.
Because we could
not have control
of the selection and the caret.
We looked at Google
Docs with envy,
because they were able to style
the caret how they wanted.
They threw away contenteditable.
And for Google Docs they're
using the Kix engine.
They can style a
caret, color it.
They can have several cursors on
the screen, with people's names
on it.
And it also gave them
great usability capability.
Because if, for example,
you're in an italic font,
you can slant the caret
to give hint to the user
where they're about to edit.
Or if they've got command
overrides, when-- when they
press Command bold, you
can make the caret thicker.
So that they know that
the next time they're
going to type
characters, they're
all going to come out thick.
And so we looked at--
we looked at that
and we said, why don't the
browsers give us capabilities
so we can use them?
And so we thought it would
be so great if we could
do what they do,
and just have a div,
and basically write an API
that will allow everyone
to basically build
their own editor,
and they can use
their own carets,
and they can have as many
as they want on the screen,
and they can to
telepointing and all that.
And we thought it
was impossible.
In fact, I had a dream
of having, writing
WYSIWYG Vim editor
in the browser.
I love Vim.
And I thought the
greatest thing I could do
is write this WYSIWYG
Vim editing command-like
thing on the browser.
But it would be impossible.
Because I didn't have
this control with carets.
I could go into all
of that, but basically
caret positioning
very difficult.
But we had a breakthrough.
And it came when we discovered
some really, really weird APIs
in the browser, just
hidden in there,
really, really hidden in there.
And they were like awful.
Like they were-- each one was
buggie, like in a weird way.
But cobbling these
together, we were
able to actually solve this.
And we were able to basically
get rid of contenteditable
altogether by being able to
control the caret positioning,
all of it.
So we can do WYSIWYG editing,
everything-- everything
is in user space in JavaScript.
And this is now delivered
as a library to users.
And so what we thought is
that instead of just building
an editor, what we want to
do is build capabilities,
and build the tools that others
can build editors and editing
experiences on.
We don't invent the future.
We do have a big dream, a dream
where the web is writable,
a dream where the web is rich,
and a dream where creating
content for the web is natural.
But we don't have a
roadmap for that future.
What we now do have is
just the capability.
And what we're doing,
is as fast as we can,
is we want to put the
capability right there
and see what people do with it.
We can't invent the future,
but we can enable it.
Usability, accessibility,
capability; these
are key in user experience.
But it is the capability that
affords us the other two.
It is capability that gives us
breakthrough in accessibility.
It is capability
that short-circuits
our accessibility bias,
and our perception bias,
and allows people to
enable the future.
As I was sharing these ideas
with a colleague at work,
I was just talking about
and reasoning this with him,
and he just had a great
comment at the end.
He looked at me,
and he said, Petro
I know exactly
what you're saying.
You're saying, don't
start the resolution.
Enable the resolution to start.
And I was like, awesome.
So shout out to
Christopher Sugnig.
Don't start a revolution,
but harness capabilities,
develop capabilities,
ship capabilities,
and enable the
revolution to start.
Dream big.
Think small.
Thank you, guys.
Wow, come over to the chill
lounge for the last time.
I'm going to miss this place.
It's been lovely.
(petro salema) I'm leaving
death on the screen.
Hang on.

Don't leave death on the screen.

Well I thought it
was really interesting
that we opened the conference
yesterday with Hayden telling
us that the important
thing to remember
is that we're all going to die.

And you closed the conference
with death as well.
So if that's-- that's something
we can all take away from
the event.

That was absolutely
incredible, by the way.
And I feel-- I feel
like I can't really
do it justice with questions.

What do you feel about
the ES Promises API?
No, seriously though-- is
there-- is there actually--
how much value is
there in innovation?
I mean take your Xerox
example, or even the iPhone.
When the iPhones hit the
scene, everyone thought, wow.
This touchscreen is incredible.

But touchscreen wasn't new.

Like, it had been around for
ages, just not done very well,
and same with like
Windows, who's
taken what Xerox did
and just made it better.
What's-- is there-- is there
value in trying to innovate
wildly, or is better to look
at the things that have kind
of not quite got there, and
just take that the extra mile?
I think both.

I recall reading that a lot
of the consumer technologies
that we actually--
the foundation
of a lot of the
consumer technologies
that we use today, a lot
of that core technology
actually came out from a
project, a military project
in America during I
think World War II,
where the government
just invested
tons and tons of money.

And for like years
nothing came out of that.
And these guys were literally
just doing sci-fi stuff.
But sooner or
later, they came up
with things--
innovations in radar
and in all these other things.

And actually Silicon
Valley was born out
of that sort of-- that
sort of experimentation.
And those things actually
did lay the groundwork
for a lot of the things
that we built on top.
So there is definitely
value in wild innovation.
But what actually happens
is that oftentimes it's
the hackers that
have a breakthrough.
But it is the mainstream
or the-- those
who wear suits and are more
representable, you know,
who dismiss it.

The breakthrough, I
think, that happened
with the iPhone was
not in-- was not
necessarily in the touchscreen.

Of course they had-- they
really fine-tuned it.
They really did id really well.

But what they did is that they
took multi-touch, and married
it with a really, really
fantastic user interface.
And so they made it very usable.

At the end, it made
the human being--
it empowered the human being.

It wasn't like, oh yeah.

This is an incredible
capability.
But we'll need to train
you like an astronaut
before you can use it.

And so on the one hand,
wild innovation is--
is really great.

But it is important to find a--
basically a practical way where
you can take that innovation,
and really just ship it.
Bring it to a human
being in a way
that is actually manageable.

Don't shoot a rocket at them,
and tell them to eat it.
I guess-- sort of a historical
example would be the laser.
Like some scientists
invented the laser.
Look, look.

We invented the laser.

Well, what does it do?

And it wasn't until
many year later
that we saw all of
the actual, I guess,
products being built
with that in mind.
What are we seeing
that happen with now?
I guess-- I guess the
Oculus, I guess-- is that?
Are we seeing VR sort of
being done correctly now?
Or are we extra
steps away from that?
What else is almost there?

Well, I actually
think-- I don't know.
We don't know.

I think that's the point.

We really don't know.

But I think our duty is to build
things which we can actually
get to users, and
not to dismiss them.
I don't know.

The thing is that the future
always catches up to us,
and it just does a
peek-a-boo on us.
So we'll be looking,
Oculus, we're
saying we're nearly there.

We're nearly there.

But somehow I just keep puking.

And then someone-- and then
someone comes in and says,
you know what you're missing.

You forgot to squeeze a lemon on
top of-- on top of the device.
And all of sudden it cures it.

And we're like what?

And that's the way it happens.

So I don't know.

But this is the part of the
thrill of what we're doing.
I think what we
need to focus on is
delivering these capabilities,
and not just hoping
to build this massive
Superdome, where we then
will control the whole
virtual reality experience,
but give it to people.

And give to developers
so that they can actually
build something with it.

Give something that's smaller.

Because you don't know
how virtual reality-- what
virtual reality will be used
for, medicine, shopping;
we don't know these things.

I suppose-- when
you were talking
about accessibility bias.

I think that sci-fi movies
are a great example of that.
I mean you were looking
at "Back to the Future."
Someone went, what's
the future have?
It's got a skateboard,
but without wheels, right?
That's the closest thing.

That's right.

I forgot that.

A great example was
"Minority Report."
And it was something
that there for a while,
the interfaces were amazing.

Because you can just control
things with gestures as long as
you put on some gloves.

And then Microsoft
released the Connect.
Like you do not need the gloves.

What kind of
element of UX do you
think is tying us
down currently?
What bits of legacy
are holding us back?
Oh, good question.

Well you know that
"The Minority Report"
thing didn't work, right?

I actually tried this at home.

I actually tried to
build my own thing.
And I got that
whole thing to work.
I put these colored
tabs on my fingers.
Because I love UX.

And I was just doing all things.

I could control.

I could do double-click.

But do you know what
happens when you do that
for like five minutes?

Gorilla arms.

You know, you can't do
the whole Tom Cruise
thing where he had a
cut every five minutes,
and hat is dusted off,
and he had a drink.
So that doesn't work.

But-- but exactly, that's
accessibility bias.
We envision all these things.

But to get to really
work for a human being
is really difficult.

What are the things that
are holding us back?
You know, I don't want to
make a political statement.
But I've been really, really
interrogating this thought,
and I've been thinking.

The mobile revolution has
brought us a lot of things.
It's actually a really
significant thing
that happened.

Computing is in our pocket.

But I really see that there is a
tension, and perhaps a problem,
where we've lost some of
the openness of the web.
Some of the maybe-- I don't
know-- flexibility of it.
I mean I got into this thing
because I was finally--
we had these great programmers
at school in Tanzania.
But they thought I was a jerk.

So they would never let
me-- I was a little kid.
And I was like, just show me
what this awesome equation is.
How do your-- how do
harness these powers?
And they just brushed me away.

And then they made these awesome
games on their computers.
But when I do view source
that was it for me.
And that was like the blue pill
or the red pill or whatever,
in the Morpheus where the
lightning bolt happened,
and I went one way.

And here I am.

And with an open
web, we had a lot--
we have a lot of
opportunity for us
to basically take what we
need from the native system,
and build on top of it.

But I feel-- and
the way I've said
it is that it feels like mobile
is actually like a padded cell.
You know, it's really--
It's really tricked out
with awesome things.

But you're kind of
trapped in there.
And it's very cumbersome
to develop for it.
And it's brought us really far.

And it's even spoken into the
web and how we build software.
But I really wonder
whether it will
allow us to innovate
as vigorous as we
were able to do on the web.

So it could be that there
is a curse in that blessing.
I think-- especially
sort of going back
to "The Minority Report" thing,
the idea of the interface not
quite working, due to
sort of stress on your arms.
I remember I was--
I had appendicitis,
and I went to hospital when
was I think 
And my friend loaned
me his Game Boy.
But being in a hospital
bed and playing Tetris,
and I remember I could
only get to level nine
before it would just
slowly hit me in the face.
Because I had no
blood left in my arms.
Let's talk about Windows .

I mean they tried some
pretty incredible stuff
in terms of UX innovation.

Like, it was probably
the most radical change
we've seen from a mainstream
OS as far as, I guess,
until Windows XP
or Windows 
What did they do wrong?

Or is it just a matter
of time before we
realize they were right?

Another good question.

I don't know.

But I think the
verdict that came out
was it just surprised
people in the wrong way.
And it really surprised me.

I did use Windows .

And I was trying to
find out how to quit.
And I'm not like nube.

OK?

And I was using control alt
delete as like-- as a default
way of quitting.

And so something
there is not right.
You know?

Somehow you didn't
serve the human
when you forced him to basically
pull out the hacker on him.
So I think it's where
you marry the technology
with human beings.

It's not just about making
it, you know, clean design
and thinking, and astronauting--
astronauting a system.
Eventually it's really got
to work with human beings.
I wonder if you want to
do something as radical
as that, like what
Windows  tried to do.
Maybe they should have taken
more of like the Facebook
approach, where they--
they change a feature.
And everyone goes,
I don't like this.
And they're like,
you'll get used to it.
And they just keep pushing
the platform like that.
They do do that.

They do do that.

I think what they--
I think ultimately
when we use computers
for the features.
And so we don't really--
I'm not interested
in the whole operating
system as such.
I'm really interested
in the programs.
For example, I have a Mac there.

But the thing I use it for
mostly is for the browsing
and for Vim.

OK, those are the things
I use my program most for.
And I can do that
any, any UNIX system.
I think you've got to work
on highlighting the features,
and bring-- and building
great-- just great capabilities
in the system, and not
so much on astronauting
the whole system in itself.

I don't know.

Maybe less is more.

Less things flying around at
you, and less changes there,
and just building greater
products within the system.
I don't know.

But that's just a guess.

That's absolutely amazing.

A huge round of applause
for Petro Salema.
