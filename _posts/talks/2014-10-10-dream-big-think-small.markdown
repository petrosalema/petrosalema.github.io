Hoverboards, jetpacks, holograms, and "the next big thing:" none are everyday
technologies not because we can't envision them, but because we haven't yet put
together the capabilities to make them consumable technologies.

The buzzing, blinking, and beeping atmosphere mediated by our ever-on,
ever-connected, and ever-present devices has made it clear that computer
technology revolutions will be grounded in making computing more humane (UX).
But what the next lifestyle shaping and culture-making product will be is almost
impossible to say. It's very hard to invent the future, but it is our job—and
within our reach—to enable it. And the key to this is solving smaller problems.

We'll consider how solving small and hard problems is what brings about
capabilities, and it is capabilities—more so than vision—that is the link
between our imagination and reality<b>.</b>
