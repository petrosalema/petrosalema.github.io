The advent of the World Wide Web brought far-reaching changes in human computer
interaction, and mobile computing has done it at an even greater extent. Turning
knobs and flicking switches became pressing keys and moving a mouse. This in
turn has become tapping screens and swiping. And this is only the beginning.

Web development is acclimatizing itself to a new keyboard- and mouse-free,
screen-orientated mainstream. But what happens to web development when new
categories of devices mean that even the touch-screen cannot be assumed?

Computer user interfaces change. What remains the same, however, is the human
body that drives interaction. So this talk will discuss an experiment that
explores developing touch-less human computer interaction with JavaScript for
content creation on a mobile World Wide Web.

This talks was first given at the <a href="http://www.gentics.com/jquery-eu-2014/page/2014/eu.html">2014 jQuery Europe Conference.</a>
