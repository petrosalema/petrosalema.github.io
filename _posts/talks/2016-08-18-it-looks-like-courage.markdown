The greatest limitation that keeps teams and individuals operating below their
true creative capacity is not a lack of imagination or talent, but rather a lack
in the ability to underwrite the risk that is unavoidable in the creative
process.

In other words: courage.

It feels safer to copy and fail, and be congratulated for having at least done
it canonically "right," than it is to test unchartered ideas and fail, and be
considered a fool. Hence: "innovation" bandwagons.

Yet every true act of creation is risk.

And the cost of allowing our impulse
towards comfort to keep us operating below our creative capacity is colossal
loss---for us personally, for our users, and the innovation that is the future
viability of any organization.

Courage---not imagination or skill---is the essence of our
creative capacity.

Courage is not an emotion, it is a principle of execution: executing on the
basis of achieving gain rather than averting loss. Courage is not confidence of
success, it is the willingness to underwrite the risk of failure. Courage is
about thinking hard about first principles: asking "why" instead of just the
"what" or the "how."

In this talk I translate these principles into how we go about the process of
designing software, building teams, and developing plans. My aim is to give a
framework that can help us all escape the temptation to imprison ourselves into
coloring within the lines of other peoples success, and instead develop the
courage to exercise our true creative potential<b>.</b>
